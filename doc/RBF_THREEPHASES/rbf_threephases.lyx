\begin_layout Abstract
Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks are well established machine learning tools used in a variety of classification and regression problems.
 A key component of these networks is their radial functions.
 These networks acquire adaptive capabilities through a two-stage training technique in most cases.
 In the first stage,
 the centers and variances for the radial functions are estimated,
 and in the second stage,
 through the solution of a linear system,
 the external weights for the radial functions are adjusted.
 However,
 in many cases this training technique has reduced performance either due to instability in arithmetic operations or due to trapping in local minima of the training error.
 In this paper,
 a three-stage method is proposed to address the above problems.
 In the first stage,
 an initial estimate of the intervals for the network parameter values \SpecialChar allowbreak
\SpecialChar allowbreak
is made,
 in the second stage,
 the network parameter values are adjusted within the intervals of the first phase,
 and finally in the third stage of the proposed technique,
 a local optimization method is used for the final adjustment of the network parameters.
 The proposed method was tested for its efficiency on a wide series of regression and classification datasets from the related bibliography with exceptional results.

 Among the most used machine learning tools one can detect the Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks,
 expressed using the following definition:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R\left(\overrightarrow{x}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{k}w_{i}\phi\left(\left\Vert \overrightarrow{x}-\overrightarrow{c_{i}}\right\Vert \right)\label{eq:firstrbf}
\end{equation}

In this paper,
 the use of a three-stage technique is proposed for the effective training of RBF networks.
 In the first stage of the technique,
 the range of values for the parameters of the RBF network is detected.
 This detection is implemented using the K-Means algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kmeans"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for the weights and the variances of the radial functions.
 After applying the above procedure,
 a range of values for the network parameters is created which directly depends on the values produced by K-means algorithm.
 During the second stage of the proposed work,
 a global optimization procedure is incorporated to optimize the parameters of the RBF network with respect to equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:RbfError"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

.
 The training of the parameters is performed inside the interval of values created during the first stage of the technique.
 In the current work the Genetic Algorithm is used as the method of the second phase,
 but any optimization technique can be incorporated.
 Finally,
 in the third stage of the proposed work,
 a local optimization procedure is applied to the best solution located in the second phase.
 The purpose of the present technique is first to identify a reliable range of values \SpecialChar allowbreak
\SpecialChar allowbreak
for the parameters of RBF networks and then to train the network parameters within this range of values,
 avoiding possible arithmetic instability problems presented by the established method of training RBF networks.

 The discussion initiates with the first phase,
 where the construction of the ranges for the parameter values is performed using the K-means algorithm.
 Subsequently,
 the steps of the used Genetic Algorithm are presented in detail and finally this section concludes with the description of the final phase,

The method of K-means,
 used widely in machine learning is incorporated in the first phase for the location of the ranges for the parameters of the RBF network.
 This method is incorporated to locate the centers and the variances of the possible groups of a series of points.
 Furthermore,
 a series of extensions of this method have been published during the past years,
 such as the Genetic K-means algotithm
