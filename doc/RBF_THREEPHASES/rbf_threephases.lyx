\begin_layout Abstract
Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks are well established machine learning tools used in many practical problems,
 that can be considered as classification or regression problems.
 A key component of these networks is their radial functions.
 These networks acquire adaptive capabilities through a two-stage training technique in most cases.
 In the first stage,
 the centers and variances for the radial functions are estimated,
 and in the second stage,
 through the solution of a linear system,
 the external weights for the radial functions are adjusted.
 However,
 in many cases this training technique has reduced performance either due to instability in arithmetic operations or due to trapping in local minima of the training error.
 In this paper,
 a three-stage method is proposed to address the above problems.
 In the first stage,
 an initial estimate of the intervals for the network parameter values \SpecialChar allowbreak
\SpecialChar allowbreak
is made,
 in the second stage,
 the network parameter values are adjusted within the intervals of the first phase,
 and finally in the third stage of the proposed technique,
 a local optimization method is used for the final adjustment of the network parameters.
 The proposed method was tested for its efficiency on a wide series of regression and classification datasets from the related bibliography with exceptional results.

 Among the most used machine learning tools one can detect the Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks,
 expressed using the following definition:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R\left(\overrightarrow{x}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{k}w_{i}\phi\left(\left\Vert \overrightarrow{x}-\overrightarrow{c_{i}}\right\Vert \right)\label{eq:firstrbf}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The symbols appeared in this equation are defined as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x}$
\end_inset

 stands for the input pattern.
 The dimension of each pattern is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The constant 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 denotes number of processing units (weights) of the network.
 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{w}$
\end_inset

 denotes these weights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{c_{i}},\ i=1,..,k$
\end_inset

 denote the centers of the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(x)$
\end_inset

 usually represents a Gaussian function with the following definition:

 The training error of any given 
\begin_inset Formula $R(x)$

 RBF network is defined as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E\left(R\left(\overrightarrow{x}\right)\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(R\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}\label{eq:RbfError}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},y_{i}\right),\ i=1,...,M$
\end_inset

 denotes the training set of the objective problem and the values 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 are considered as the actual output for each pattern 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x_{i}}$

In this paper,
 the use of a three-stage technique is suggested for the effective training of RBF networks.
 In the first stage of the technique,
 the range of values for the parameters of the RBF network is detected.
 This detection is implemented using the K-Means algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kmeans"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for the weights and the variances of the radial functions.
 After applying the above procedure,
 a range of values for the network parameters is created which directly depends on the values produced by K-means algorithm.
 During the second stage of the proposed work,
 a global optimization procedure is incorporated to optimize the parameters of the RBF network with respect to equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:RbfError"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

.
 The training of the parameters is performed inside the interval of values created during the first stage of the technique.
 In the current work the Genetic Algorithm is used as the method of the second phase,
 but any optimization technique can be incorporated.
 Finally,
 in the third stage of the proposed work,
 a local optimization procedure is applied to the best solution located in the second phase.
 The purpose of the present technique is first to identify a reliable range of values \SpecialChar allowbreak
\SpecialChar allowbreak
for the parameters of RBF networks and then to train the network parameters within this range of values,
 avoiding possible arithmetic instability problems presented by the established method of training RBF networks.

The three distinct phases of the proposed method are presented in detail in this section.
 The discussion initiates with the first phase,

The first phase of the proposed method 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method of K-means,
 used widely in machine learning is incorporated in the first phase for the location of the ranges for the centers and variances of the model.
 This method is incorporated to locate the centers and the variances of the possible groups of a series of points.
 Furthermore,
 a series of extensions of this method have been published during the past years,
 such as the Genetic K-means algotithm

 In the proposed implementation the Genetic Algorithm was incorporated during the second phase.
 Genetic algorithm are evolutionary methods,
 that are based on randomly produced solutions of the objective problem.
 The trial solutions of the genetic algorithm are commonly called chromosomes and they are evolved through some operations that mimic some natural processes,
 such as selection,
 crossover and mutation.
 Genetic algorithms have been used in a wide series of problems,
 such as energy problems

Experimental results 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the experiments were executed on a Debian Linux system with 128GB of RAM.
 The programming language used was C++ and for the optimization method the OPTIMUS optimization environment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "optimus"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 was incorporated.
 The results were validated using the ten - fold cross validation technique.
 For the classification datasets the average classification error,
 calculated on the corresponding test set,
 is reported.
 This quantity is expressed using the following equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{C}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)=100\times\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(\mbox{class}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)-y_{i}\right)}{N}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Where the set 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 denotes the related test set and it is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $T=\left(x_{i},y_{i}\right),\ i=1,\ldots,N$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly,
 for the regression datasets,
 the average regression is reported which is calculated as follows:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{R}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},\overrightarrow{w}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}}{N}

 reports thirty-two classification datasets and six learning methods:
 BFGS,
 ADAM,
 NEAT,
 RBF-KMEANS,
 GENRBF,
 and the new proposed method.
 The entries are classification error rates;
 lower values indicate better performance.
 The last row gives the mean error for each method across all datasets.
 Based on these means,
 the proposed method attains the lowest overall error,
 about 19.45%.
 All other methods exhibit substantially higher errors:
 GENRBF 34.89%,
 ADAM 33.73%,
 BFGS 33.50%,
 NEAT 32.77%,
 and RBF-KMEANS 28.54%.
 Thus,
 on average,
 the proposed method nearly halves the error relative to the alternatives.
 At the dataset level,
 the proposed approach often delivers striking gains.
 For example,
 on Spiral it achieves only 13.26% error,
 whereas all other methods lie around 45–50%.
 On Australian it yields 22.67% compared with 32–42% for the others.
 Similarly,
 on the challenging medical dataset Cleveland,
 it obtains 50.86% while the others exceed 67%.
 Comparable advantages are observed on Heart,
 HeartAttack,
 Statheart,
 Wine,
 and Z_F_S.
 There are,
 however,
 datasets where the proposed method is not the best.
 On Hayes Roth and Zoo it performs worse than GENRBF or RBF-KMEANS,
 and on Transfusion the results are broadly similar to the other methods,
 with no clear advantage.
 This indicates that although the method does not dominate in every single problem,
 the overall trend clearly favors it.
 In summary,
 the statistical picture suggests that the proposed method is,
 on average,
 the most reliable and effective strategy,
 producing markedly lower classification errors.
 While it lags behind certain alternatives on a few datasets,
 its low mean error underscores a more general and robust solution for classification tasks.

Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expRegression"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 reports twenty-one regression datasets and six machine-learning models:
 BFGS,
 ADAM,
 NEAT,
 RBF-KMEANS,
 GENRBF,
 and the proposed method.
 The entries are absolute prediction errors;
 smaller values indicate better model performance.
 The last row gives the mean error for each method across all datasets.
 The analysis of the means clearly shows that the proposed method attains the smallest overall error,
 5.87.
 The remaining methods have substantially higher errors:
 BFGS 28.82,
 ADAM 21.39,
 NEAT 13.99,
 RBF-KMEANS 9.56,
 and GENRBF 13.38.
 This implies that the proposed approach greatly improves accuracy,
 reducing the average error to nearly half of the best competing model and far more compared with the classical BFGS and ADAM.
 At the dataset level there are striking gaps.
 On Housing the proposed method records an error of 15.36,
 whereas the other models range from 56 to 97.
 On Stock the contrast is even stronger,
 with an error of only 1.44 while others reach well above 300.
 Similarly,
 on Plastic the error drops to 2.28,
 while the alternatives lie between 8 and 26.
 Comparable advantages are observed on Mortgage,
 Treasury,
 Concrete,
 HO,
 Quake,
 and PL.
 There are,
 however,
 a few cases where the proposed method is not the best;
 for example,
 on FY and SN it shows slightly higher errors than some competitors,
 though the differences are small,
 so no clear advantage emerges there.
 Overall,
 the evidence indicates that the proposed method is the most reliable and effective option on average,
 substantially reducing regression error relative to all other techniques.
 Although it does not lead on every dataset,
 the large reduction in mean error and the strong results on several difficult problems demonstrate a robust and broadly applicable solution for regression tasks.

Based on the executions carried out with scripts in the R language concerning the processing of the experimental results on the classification datasets,
 the significance levels of the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 parameter were calculated in order to assess the statistical strength of the comparisons between the proposed model and the alternative methods.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:statClass"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 these significance levels are illustrated according to the established scale,
 where ns indicates no statistically significant difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p>0.005\right)$
\end_inset

,
 while the presence of one to four asterisks denotes increasing statistical strength,
 from significant 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p<0.05\right)$
\end_inset

 to very extremely significant 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p<0.0001\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The results show that in all comparisons of the proposed model with the other methods,
 namely BFGS,
 ADAM,
 NEAT,
 RBF-KMEANS,
 and GENRBF,
 the significance levels were found at the highest level with 
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.0001$
\end_inset

.
 This indicates that the performance differences are not random but instead reflect a very strong superiority of the proposed model over all the other techniques examined.

Similarly,
 for the regression datasets,
 the significance levels of the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 parameter were computed to assess the statistical strength of the comparisons between the proposed model and the other methods.
 In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

,
 the significance levels are illustrated according to the established scale,
 where two asterisks correspond to high statistical significance 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p<0.01\right)$
\end_inset

 and four asterisks indicate a very extremely significant difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p<0.0001\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The results show that,
 in comparison with the BFGS and ADAM models,
 the proposed method achieves high statistical significance with 
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.01$
\end_inset

,
 demonstrating that its superiority is not due to chance.
 Furthermore,
 in all other comparisons,
 namely against NEAT,
 RBF-KMEANS,
 and GENRBF,
 the significance levels reach the highest level with 
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.0001$
\end_inset

,
 which highlights a very strong superiority of the proposed model over the alternative regression methods examined.

Experiments with different values of scale factor 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to evaluate the stability and reliability of the proposed method when its critical parameters change,
 a series of additional experiments were executed.
 In one of them,
 the stability of the technique was studied with the change of the scale factor 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

.
 This factor controls the width of the value interval for the network parameters and is a multiple of the initial values estimated by the K-means method of the first phase.
 In this series of experiments the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 was altered in the range 
\begin_inset Formula $[1,8]$
\end_inset

.

Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 presents the effect of the scale factor 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 on the performance of the proposed machine learning model.
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 takes four different values,
 1,
 2,
 4,
 and 8,
 and for each dataset the classification error rate is reported.
 Analyzing the mean values,
 it is observed that 
\begin_inset Formula $F=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F=4$
\end_inset

 achieve the best overall performance,
 with average errors of 19.45% and 18.53% respectively,
 compared to 20.99% for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1$
\end_inset

 and 18.60% for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=8$
\end_inset

.
 This indicates that selecting an intermediate value of the initialization factor improves performance,
 reducing the error by about two percentage points relative to the baseline case of 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1$
\end_inset

.
 At the individual dataset level,
 interesting patterns emerge.
 For example,
 in Sonar the error drops significantly from 32.90% at 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1$
\end_inset

 to 18.75% at 
\begin_inset Formula $F=4$
\end_inset

,
 suggesting that the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 strongly influences performance in certain problems.
 In contrast,
 in Spiral increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 worsens the results,
 as the error rises from 12.03% at 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1$
\end_inset

 to 23.56% at 
\begin_inset Formula $F=8$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly,
 in the Australian dataset a gradual increase of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 from 1 to 8 systematically improves performance,
 reducing the error from 24.04% to 20.59%.
 Overall,
 the data show that the effect of the scale factor is not uniform across all problems,
 but the general trend indicates improvement when 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 increases from 1 to 2 or 4.
 Choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $F=4$
\end_inset

 appears to yield the best mean result,
 although the difference compared with 
\begin_inset Formula $F=8$
\end_inset

 is very small.
 Therefore,
 it can be concluded that tuning this parameter plays an important role in the stability and accuracy of the model,
 and that intermediate values such as 4 constitute a good general choice.

Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expRegressionF"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 shows the effect of the scale factor 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 on the performance of the proposed regression model.
 Based on the mean errors,
 the best overall performance occurs at 
\begin_inset Formula $F=4$
\end_inset

 with an average error of 5.68,
 while the values for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1,F=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F=8$
\end_inset

 are 5.94,
 5.87,
 and 5.78,
 respectively.
 The differences across the four settings are not large,
 but they indicate that intermediate values and especially 
\begin_inset Formula $F=4$
\end_inset

 tend to offer the best accuracy stability trade-off.
 At the level of individual datasets,
 substantial variations are observed.
 For Friedman the reduction is dramatic,
 with error dropping from 6.74 at 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1$
\end_inset

 to 1.41 at 
\begin_inset Formula $F=8$
\end_inset

,
 highlighting that proper tuning of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 can have a strong impact on performance.
 Laser shows a similarly large improvement,
 from 0.027 at 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1$
\end_inset

 to just 0.0024 at 
\begin_inset Formula $F=8$
\end_inset

.
 Mortgage also improves markedly,
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $0.67$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1$
\end_inset

 to 0.015 at 
\begin_inset Formula $F=8$
\end_inset

.
 By contrast,
 in some datasets the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 has little practical effect,
 such as Quake and HO,
 where errors remain nearly constant regardless of F.
 There are also cases like Housing where increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 degrades performance,
 with error rising from 14.64 at 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1$
\end_inset

 to 18.48 at 
\begin_inset Formula $F=8$
\end_inset

.
 Overall,
 the results indicate that the scale factor 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 has a significant but nonuniform influence on model performance.
 In some datasets it sharply reduces error,
 while in others its impact is negligible or even negative.
 Nevertheless,
 the aggregate picture based on the mean errors suggests that 
\begin_inset Formula $F=4$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F=8$
\end_inset

 yield the most reliable results,
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $F=4$
\end_inset

 being the preferred choice for a general-purpose setting.

,
 the significance levels are presented for the comparisons between different values of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 in the proposed machine learning method based on the classification datasets.
 The analysis shows that the comparison between 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F=2$
\end_inset

 results in high statistical significance with 
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.01$
\end_inset

,
 indicating that the transition from the initial value to 
\begin_inset Formula $F=2$
\end_inset

 has a substantial impact on performance.
 Similarly,
 the comparison between 
\begin_inset Formula $F=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F=4$
\end_inset

 also shows high statistical significance with 
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.01$
\end_inset

,
 suggesting that further increasing the parameter continues to positively affect the results.
 However,
 the comparison between 
\begin_inset Formula $F=4$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F=8$
\end_inset

 is characterized as not statistically significant,
 since 
\begin_inset Formula $p>0.05$
\end_inset

,
 which means that increasing the parameter beyond 
\begin_inset Formula $F=4$
\end_inset

 does not bring a meaningful difference in performance.
 Overall,
 the findings indicate that smaller values of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 play a critical role in improving the model,
 while increases beyond 4 do not lead to further statistically significant improvements.

 the significance levels are presented for the comparisons between different values of the parameter F in the proposed method based on the regression datasets.
 The results show that none of the comparisons

 exhibit statistically significant differences,
 since in all cases 
\begin_inset Formula $p>0.05$
\end_inset

 This means that variations in the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 do not substantially affect the performance of the model in regression problems.
 Therefore,
 it can be concluded that the choice of the 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 value is not of critical importance for these datasets and that the model remains stable regardless of the specific setting of this parameter.

Experiments with differential initialization methods for variances

Additionally,
 the stability of the proposed method was checked using a different way of calculating the range of values of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 parameters of the radial functions.
 In this work,
 the value of the variance produced by the K-means algorithm was used as an initial estimate of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 parameters.
 This calculation scheme is denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

 in the following experimental tables.
 In this additional set of experiments,
 two more techniques were used,
 which will be denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mbox{avg}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mbox{max}}$
\end_inset

 in the following tables.
 In the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mbox{avg}}$
\end_inset

 the following calculation is performed:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\mbox{avg}}=\frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^{k}\sigma_{i}\label{eq:sigma_avg}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Subsequently 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mbox{avg}}$
\end_inset

 is used to determine the range of values of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 parameters of the radial functions of the network.
 In the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mbox{avg}}$
\end_inset

 the following quantity is calculated:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\mbox{max}}=\max\sigma_{i}\label{eq:sigma_max}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Afterwards this quantity is used for the determination of the range of values for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 parameters of the radial functions.

Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expClassSigma"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 presents the effect of three different calculation techniques for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 parameters used in the radial basis functions of the RBF model.
 The techniques are a fixed value 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

,
 the mean distance-based initialization 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\sigma_{\mbox{avg}}\right)$
\end_inset

,
 and the maximum distance–based initialization 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\sigma_{\mbox{max}}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Based on the mean errors,
 the maximum-distance technique yields the lowest overall error at 19.18%.
 Very close is the mean-distance technique at 19.27%,
 while the simple 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

 initialization has a slightly higher error of 19.45%.
 Although the differences among the three approaches are small,
 the two adaptive methods 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\sigma_{\mbox{avg}}\ \mbox{and}\ \sigma_{\mbox{max}}\right)$
\end_inset

 tend to produce marginally better overall performance.
 At the individual dataset level,
 behaviors vary.
 For example,
 on Wine the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mbox{max}}$
\end_inset

 choice reduces error to 7.06%,
 far below the 9.47% obtained with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 On Dermatology,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

 performs better than the other two,
 whereas on Segment the mean-based option is preferable.
 In some cases the differences are minor e.g.,
 Circular,
 Pima,
 and Popfailures where all techniques are comparable;
 in others the choice of technique materially affects performance,
 as in Transfusion,
 where error drops from 26.04% with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

 to about 22.78% with the other two methods.
 Overall,
 the statistical picture indicates that no single technique dominates across all datasets.
 Nevertheless,
 methods that adapt 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 to the geometry of the data 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\sigma_{\mbox{avg}}\ \mbox{and}\ \sigma_{\mbox{max}}\right)$
\end_inset

 tend to yield more reliable and stable results,
 while the fixed value lags slightly.
 The average differences are modest,
 but for certain problems the choice can significantly impact final performance.

Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 presents the effect of three different calculation techniques for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 parameters used in the radial basis functions of RBF model.
 Based on the mean errors,
 the distance–average method yields the lowest overall error at 5.81.
 Very close is the fixed value 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

 with a mean error of 5.87,
 while the maximum-distance method shows a slightly higher mean error of 5.96.
 The difference among the three methods is small,
 indicating that all can deliver comparable performance at a general level,
 with a slight advantage for the distance–average approach.
 At the level of individual datasets,
 however,
 significant variations are observed.
 For example,
 in Mortgage the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mbox{max}}$
\end_inset

 method reduces the error dramatically from 0.23 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

 to 0.021,
 while 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mbox{avg}}$
\end_inset

 also provides a much better result with 0.041.
 In Treasury the improvement is again substantial,
 as the error decreases from 0.47 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

 to just 0.08 using 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mbox{max}}$
\end_inset

.
 In Stock the reduction is clear,
 from 1.44 to 1.23,
 while in Plastic both 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mbox{avg}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mbox{max}}$
\end_inset

 yield lower errors than 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand,
 in datasets such as Housing,
 the use of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\mbox{max}}$
\end_inset

 worsens performance,
 increasing the error from 15.36 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

 to 19.45.
 Similarly,
 in Auto and Baseball the lowest errors are obtained with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

,
 whereas the alternative techniques result in slightly worse performance.
 Overall,
 the results show that the choice of calculation technique for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 can significantly affect performance in certain problems,
 while in others the difference is negligible.
 Although no method consistently outperforms the others across all datasets,
 the distance–average method appears slightly more reliable overall,
 while the maximum-distance method can in some cases produce very large improvements but in others lead to a degradation of performance.

\begin_layout Standard
The final experimental evidence shows that the three-phase RBF training pipeline bound construction via K-means,
 global search with a GA inside those bounds,
 and local refinement with BFGS yields robust gains across heterogeneous classification and regression tasks.
 On classification,
 it achieves the lowest mean error (19.45%) with extremely significant superiority over all baselines 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p<0.0001\right)$
\end_inset

,
 on regression,
 it attains the smallest mean absolute error (5.87),
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.01$
\end_inset

 against BFGS/ADAM and 
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.0001$
\end_inset

 against NEAT/RBF-KMEANS/GENRBF.
 These results indicate that coupling broad exploration with constrained,
 precise local tuning mitigates numerical instability and local minima,
 providing reproducible performance improvements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sensitivity analyses reveal that the scale factor 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 materially affects classification at small-to-intermediate settings (
\begin_inset Formula $F=1\rightarrow2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F=2\rightarrow4$
\end_inset

 are significant at 
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.01$
\end_inset

),
 with no meaningful gain from 
\begin_inset Formula $F=4$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $F=8$
\end_inset

,
 whereas for regression the 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 comparisons are not significant,
 highlighting methodological stability.
 Alternative 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 computation methods 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\sigma_{1},\ \sigma_{\mbox{avg}},\ \sigma_{\mbox{max}}\right)$
\end_inset

 differ only marginally on average and show no significant differences in either task,
 reinforcing the method’s resilience to low-level design choices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Automating architecture and hyperparameter adaptation is a natural next step.
 Joint optimization of the number of RBF units,
 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

,
 and bounds via Bayesian optimization or meta-learning could reduce manual tuning and improve generalization.
 Exploring alternative global optimizers (e.g.,
 DE,
 PSO,
 CMA-ES) or hybrid GA and Bayesian strategies may accelerate convergence and enhance exploration,
 while in the final stage L-BFGS,
 bound-aware variants,
 and stochastic formulations could benefit large-scale,
 high-dimensional settings.
 A thorough ablation study to quantify each phase’s contribution,
 along with broader post-hoc statistics,
 would strengthen the evidence base.
 From a systems perspective,
 parallel/distributed GA evaluations and GPU-accelerated RBF computations can materially cut runtime.
 Finally,
 extending benchmarks to strong non-RBF baselines and integrating the approach into AutoML pipelines together with analyses of interpretability and predictive uncertainty will provide a more complete picture of the method’s limits and potential.
