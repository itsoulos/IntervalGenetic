\abstract{Screening and evaluation of developmental disorders include complex
and tough procedures, exhibit uncertainties in the diagnostic fit,
and require high clinical expertise. Traditionally, clinicians rely
on diagnostic instrumentation, child observations, and parents’ reports
resulting occasionally to subjective evaluation outcomes. Current
advances in artificial intelligence offer new opportunities for decision
making, classification and clinical assessment. The current study
explores the performance of different neural networks optimizers in
biometric datasets for screening typically and non-typically developed
children for speech and language communication deficiencies. The main
motivation was to give clinicians a robust tool to help them identify
speech disorders automatically by using artificial intelligence methodologies.
For this reason, in this study a new dataset from an innovative, recently
developed serious game that focuses on collecting a variety of data
on children’s speech and language abilities was used. Specifically,
a variety of neural network approaches were used by utilizing state-of-the-art
optimization algorithms such as the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno
(BFGS), the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and a Genetic algorithm,
along with an Integer bounded Neural Network (INN). The results were
promising, while INN proved to be the best competitor, opening new
inquiring for future work towards automated classification supporting
clinician’s decisions on developmental disorders.}

\section{Introduction}

Artificial Neural networks (ANNs) are parametric machine learning
tools \citep{nn1,nn2} that are utilizing a seires of parameters commonly
called weights or processing units. These tools have found application
in a variety of scientific areas, such as physics \citep{nnphysics1,nnphysics2,nnphysics3},
solution of differential equations \citep{nnde1,nnde2}, agriculture
\citep{nnagr1,nnagr2}, chemistry \citep{nnchem1,nnchem2,nnchem3},
economics \citep{nnecon1,nnecon2,nncecon3}, medicine \citep{nnmed1,nnmed2}
etc. Also, recently, neural networks have been used in solar radiation
prediction \citep{nnsolar}, 3D printing \citep{nn3d}, lung cancer
research \citep{nnlung} etc. A neural network $N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)$
can be expressed as a summation of processing units as suggested in
\citep{nnc}:
\begin{equation}
N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{H}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)}\sigma\left(\sum_{j=1}^{d}x_{j}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)+j}+w_{(d+2)i}\right)\label{eq:nn}
\end{equation}
where the constant $H$ defines the total number of processing units
for the network and the value $d$ is considered as the dimension
of vector $\overrightarrow{x}$. The function $\sigma(x)$ is called
sigmoid function and it is defined as: 
\begin{equation}
\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}\label{eq:sig}
\end{equation}
The training error of the neural network is defined as:
\begin{equation}
E\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x}_{i},\overrightarrow{w}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}
where the set $\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},y_{i}\right),\ i=1,...,M$
is the training dataset for the neural network and $y_{i}$ stands
for the actual output for the input pattern $\overrightarrow{x_{i}}$
. Essentially, the training of the artificial neural network consists
in determining the optimal vector of parameters $\overrightarrow{w}$
through the minimization of equation \ref{eq:eq1}. During the recent
years a variety of optimization methods have been proposed to minimize
this equation such as the Back Propagation method \citep{bpnn,bpnn2},
the RPROP method \citep{rpropnn,rpropnn3,rpropnn2}, Quasi Newton
methods \citep{quasinn,quasinn2}, Simulated Annealing \citep{nn_ann1,nn_ann2},
Genetic Algorithms \citep{geneticnn,geneticnn2}, Particle Swarm Optimization
\citep{psonn,psonn2} etc.
