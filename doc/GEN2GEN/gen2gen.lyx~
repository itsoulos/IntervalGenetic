\begin_layout Abstract
Artificial neural networks have been used in a multitude of applications in various research areas in recent decades,
 providing excellent results in both data classification and data fitting.
 Their success is based on the effective identification (training) of their parameters using optimization techniques,
 and in this direction,
 a multitude of techniques have been developed for training these models.
 However,
 many times these techniques either get trapped in local minima of the error function with poor overall results or present overfitting problems in which the performance of the artificial neural network is significantly reduced on data that was not present during its training.
 This paper proposes a new method for the efficient training of artificial neural networks,
 where a series of genetic algorithms are applied to the network parameters in several stages.
 In the first stage,
 an initial identification of the network value interval is made,
 in the second stage,
 the initial estimate of the value interval is improved,
 and in the third stage,
 the final adjustment of the network parameters within the previously identified value interval takes place.
 The new method was evaluated on a wide series of classification and regression problems from the relevant literature,
 and it was compared against other methods used for neural network training.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
A widely used machine learning model is artificial neural network 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "nn1,nn2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In most cases artificial neural networks are defined as parametric machine learning models,
 where learning is achieved by calculating the values of their parameters through some optimization technique.
 The underlying optimization procedure should minimize the so - called training error,
 which is defined as:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x}_{i},\overrightarrow{w}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The function 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)$
\end_inset

 stands for the artificial neural network,
 vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x}$
\end_inset

 denotes the input pattern and the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{w}$
\end_inset

 stands for the parameter vector of the neural network.
 The set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},y_{i}\right),\ i=1,...,M$
\end_inset

 defines the so - called training set of the objective problem,
 where the values 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 are the expected outputs for every pattern 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x_{i}}$
\end_inset

.
 A closed form that can be used to represent neural networks was used in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "nnc"
literal "false"

\end_inset

,
 where a neural network is defined as the following function:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{H}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)}\sigma\left(\sum_{j=1}^{d}x_{j}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)+j}+w_{(d+2)i}\right)\label{eq:nn}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here,
 the constant 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 defines the number of processing units and the symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 stands for the dimension of the input pattern 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x}$
\end_inset

.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(x)$
\end_inset

 represents the sigmoid function:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}\label{eq:sig}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Following equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:nn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 it is deduced that the total number of elements in the weight vector are:
 
\begin_inset Formula $n=(d+2)H$
\end_inset

.

Also,
 other activation functions can be used,
 such as the tanh function with the following definition:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mbox{tanh}\left(x\right)=\frac{e^{2x}+1}{e^{2x}-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Nevertheless,
 the previous optimization methods have have a number of problems such as,
 for example,
 they can be trapped in any local minimum of the error function or they suffer from the phenomenon of overifitting.
 In overfitting,
 the artificial neural network exhibits reduced performance when it used on data that was not present during the training process.
 This problem has been studied by various researchers in the past and some methods have been proposed to handle this problem,

In this paper,
 a three - stage technique is proposed,
 which aims,
 on the one hand,
 at the effective training of artificial neural networks and,
 on the other,
 at limiting the phenomenon of overifitting.
 In the first phase of the new method,
 a genetic algorithm is used to make an initial estimate of the value interval for the parameters of the artificial neural network.
 In this genetic algorithm,
 a modified version of the training error of the artificial neural network is used in order to avoid the phenomenon of the network parameters taking large values \SpecialChar allowbreak
\SpecialChar allowbreak
and consequently the phenomenon of overifitting.

\series bold
 
\series default
In the second phase of the process,
 an interval technique using a genetic algorithm is utilized to find the optimal interval of values for the parameters of the artificial neural network using the optimal prediction made by the algorithm of the first phase.
 Finally,
 in the third phase a simple genetic algorithm is incorporated to train the artificial neural network using the bounds located in the second phase of the method.
 The proposed technique was tested on a series of classification and regression problems from various research fields and it was compared against traditional methods used for the training of neural networks.
