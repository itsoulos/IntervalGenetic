\begin_layout Abstract
In the present work, an innovative two-phase method is presented for parameter
 tuning in Radial Basis Function artificial neural networks.
 These kinds of machine learning models find application in many scientific
 fields in classification problems or in function regression.
 In the first phase, a technique based on Particle Swarm Optimization is
 performed to find a promising interval of values for the network parameters.
 Particle swarm optimization was used as it is a highly reliable method
 for global optimization problems and, in addition, it is one of the fastest
 and most flexible techniques of its class.
 In the second phase, the network is trained within the optimal interval
 using a global optimization technique such as a Genetic Algorithm.
 Furthermore, in order to speed up the training of the network and due to
 the use of a two-stage method, parallel programming techniques were utilized.
 The new method was applied to a number of well-known classification and
 regression datasets, and the results were more than promising.

Regression and data classification are two major categories of problems
 that are solved with machine learning techniques.
 Such problems appear regularly in scientific areas such as physics

 A programming tool that is used quite often to handle such problems is
 the Radial Basis Function (RBF) artificial neural network

.
 An RBF network can be expressed as a function:
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y\left(\overrightarrow{x}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{k}w_{i}\phi\left(\left\Vert \overrightarrow{x}-\overrightarrow{c_{i}}\right\Vert \right)\label{eq:firstrbf}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\series default
The following applies to the above equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x}$
\end_inset

 is the input pattern to the equation.
 The number of values in this vector is denoted as

The vectors

\begin_layout Standard
Typically, the Gaussian function can bed used as the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(x)$
\end_inset

 and it defined as:
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula

In the current work, a hybrid technique is proposed for the optimal calculation
 of the parameters of an RBF network.
 This technique consists of two phases.
 During the first phase, information is collected from the training data
 of the neural network and an attempt is made to identify a small interval
 of values for the neural network parameters.
 To identify this interval, an optimization method is used, which gradually
 creates the optimal value interval, which is estimated to give the lowest
 value for the training error of the network.
 To locate the optimal interval, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique
 is used 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "psoTutorial"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The PSO method was chosen for the first phase because it is fast and flexible
 enough for optimization problems, does not require a large number of parameters
 to be input by the user, and has been successfully used in a variety of
 problems such as flow shop scheduling

 etc.
 The detection of the value interval is performed in order to then make
 the minimization of the network error faster and more efficient in the
 second phase optimization method.
 In the second phase, the parameters of the neural network are optimized
 within the optimal value interval of the first phase.
 The optimization can be performed by any global optimization method

The proposed work uses two computational phases to optimally calculate the
 network parameters.
 In the first phase, a promising range for the parameters of the network
 is calculated through an optimization process that incorporates interval
 arithmetic.
 In the second phase, the parameters of the network are trained with the
 usage of a genetic algorithm inside the located range of the first phase.
 The following subsections analyze both of these phases in detail.

During this phase, arithmetic interval techniques are used to find a suitable
 range for the parameters of the RBF network.
 The interval techniques

 are a common method in global optimization with various applications

.
 The first phase aims to locate the most promising bounding box for the
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 parameters of the corresponding neural network.
 The initial bounding box is defined as
\series bold
 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 
\series default
which is a subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R^{\mbox{n}}}$
\end_inset

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\series default
The interval method of the first phase divides the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 subsequently by discarding areas that are not promising enough to contain
 the global minimum.
 In order to locate the best interval for the parameters of the network,
 a modified PSO algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "pso1"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 is used.
 The proposed variant of the PSO method is based on the original technique
 (algorithm 1 of
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pso1"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 ) but the particles are intervals of values and at each iteration a normalizati
on of the velocity vector takes place to avoid generating particles outside
 the original range of values.

\series bold
 
\series default
The PSO method is a global optimization method based on a population of
 candidate solutions, which in most cases are called particles.
 The method is based on two vectors: the current location of particles denoted
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{p}$
\end_inset

 and the velocity of their movement denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{u}$
\end_inset

.
 The PSO method finds the global minimum by moving the particles based on
 their previous best position as well as the best position of the total
 population of particles.

The initial bounding boxes for the centers and variances of the RBF network
 are constructed using the K-Means clustering algorithm.
 Subsequently, the initial values for the intervals

 are calculated through the algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The values for the intervals of the first 
\begin_inset Formula $(d+1)\times k$
\end_inset

 variables are obtained as a multiple of the positive quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 with the values obtained by the K-Means.
 The value 
\begin_inset Formula $B$

 is used to initialize the intervals for the output weight

 The velocity is initialized to a small sub-interval of the range of values
 for the corresponding parameter in order to avoid, as far as possible,
 excessive values for the velocity.
 This would result in the particles moving out of their value range very
 quickly and thus making the optimization process difficult.

 and

.
 However, the proposed technique is significantly slower than the original
 training technique, as it is a two-stage technique.
 In the first stage, an optimal interval of values for the network parameters
 is created with a modified PSO method, and in the second stage, the network
 is trained using a genetic algorithm.
 Of course, this extra time can be significantly reduced by incorporating
 parallel techniques, as was done experimentally using the OpenMP library.
 Furthermore, changing the normalization factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 from 100 to 1000 did not have much effect on the mean error in the test
 set.
 This induces that the proposed method is quite robust, since it doesn't
 have much dependence on this parameter.

An additional experiment was performed with different values for the parameter
 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

.
 The experimental results for this experiment are shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expsFClass"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 for the classification datasets and in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expsFRegression"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for the regression datasets.
 And for this critical parameter, no large deviations appear in the results
 of the proposed method.
 This further enhances the robustness and reliability of the proposed technique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:precisionRecall"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the metrics of precision, recall and f-score are shown for a series of
 classification datasets and for the proposed method (mentioned as IRBF-100)
 and the classic method for training RBF networks (mentioned as RBF-KMEANS)
 .And in these experimental results, the reader can see the superiority of
 the proposed technique over the traditional method of training RBF networks.

\begin_layout Standard
In the present work, a two-stage hybrid method was proposed to efficiently
 identify the parameters of RBF neural networks.
 In the first stage of the method, a technique rooted in particle swarm
 optimization was used to efficiently identify a reliable interval of values
 for the neural network parameters.
 In the second stage of the method, an intelligent global optimization technique
 was used to locate the neural network parameters within the optimal value
 interval of the first stage.
 In this work, a genetic algorithm was used in the second phase, but any
 global optimization method could be used in its place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method was applied to a multitude of classification and regression problems
 from the relevant literature.
 In almost all cases, the proposed method significantly outperforms other
 machine learning models, and on average the improvement in the error on
 the test sets was of the order of 40% relative to the established RBF training
 method.
 Moreover, the method is quite robust with respect to the basic parameters
 since any changes in the parameter values do not significantly affect its
 performance.
 Furthermore, the method can efficiently locate the value interval of network
 parameters without any prior knowledge about the type of training data
 or whether it is a classification or a regression problem.
 However, the proposed technique is significantly more time-consuming than
 the traditional training technique as it requires computational time for
 both its phases.
 Although, this effect can be overcomed to some extent by the use of modern
 parallel computing techniques.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method could be extended by the use of other techniques of training
 the parameters in RBF networks, such as, for example, the differential
 evolutionary method

.
 Furthermore, more efficient methods of terminating the first stage of the
 method could be used as finding a suitable interval of values for the network
 parameters requires many numerical calculations.
