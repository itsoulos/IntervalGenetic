\abstract{In the present work, an innovative two-phase method is presented
for parameter tuning in Radial Basis Function artificial neural networks.
These kinds of machine learning models find application in many scientific
fields in classification problems or in function regression. In the
first phase, a technique based on Particle Swarm Optimization is performed
to locate a promising interval of values for the network parameters.
Particle swarm optimization was used as it is a highly reliable method
for global optimization problems and, in addition, it is one of the
fastest and most flexible techniques of its class. In the second phase,
the network is trained within the optimal interval using a global
optimization technique such as a Genetic Algorithm. Furthermore, in
order to speed up the training of the network and due to the use of
a two-stage method, parallel programming techniques were utilized.
The new method was applied to a number famous classification and regression
datasets, and the results were more than promising.}

\section{Introduction}

Regression and data classification are two major categories of problems
that are solved with machine learning techniques. Such problems appear
regularly in scientific fields such as physics \citep{physics_ml1,physics_ml2},
chemistry \citep{chemistry_ml1,chemistry_ml2}, economics \citep{econ_ml1,econ_ml2},
medicine \citep{med_ml1,med_ml2}, etc. A programming tool that is
used quite often to handle such problems is the Radial Basis Function
(RBF) artificial neural network \citep{rbf1}. An RBF network can
be defined as the following function:\textbf{
\begin{equation}
y\left(\overrightarrow{x}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{k}w_{i}\phi\left(\left\Vert \overrightarrow{x}-\overrightarrow{c_{i}}\right\Vert \right)\label{eq:firstrbf}
\end{equation}
}The following applies to the above equation
\begin{enumerate}
\item The vector $\overrightarrow{x}$ stands for the input pattern to the
equation \ref{eq:firstrbf}. The number of elements in this vector
is denoted as $d$.
\item The vectors $\overrightarrow{c_{i}},\ i=1,..,k$ are denoted as the
center vectors.
\item The vector $\overrightarrow{w}$ is considered as the output weight
of the RBF network.
\item The value $y\left(\overrightarrow{x}\right)$ represents the predicted
value of the network for the pattern $\overrightarrow{x}$.
\end{enumerate}
Typically, the Gaussian function can bed used as the function $\phi(x)$
and it defined as:\textbf{
\begin{equation}
\phi(x)=\exp\left(-\frac{\left(x-c\right)^{2}}{\sigma^{2}}\right)
\end{equation}
}A plot for the previous function with $c=0,\ \sigma=1$ is displayed
in Figure \ref{fig:gauss}. As it is observed, the value of the function
decreases as we move away from the center. An extensive overview of
RBF networks is given in the work of Ghosh and Nag \citep{rbfghosh}.
RBF networks are used as approximation tools in various cases, such
as  solutions of differential equations \citep{rbfde1,rbfde2},\textbf{
}digital communications \citep{rbfnetwork1,rbfnetwork2},\textbf{
}physics \citep{rbfphysics1,rbfphysics2}, chemistry \citep{rbfchemistry1,rbfchemistry2},\textbf{
}economics \citep{rbfecon0,rbfecon1,rbfecon2}, network security \citep{rbf_dos1,rbf_dos2}
etc. RBF networks are thoroughly discussed in\textbf{ }\citep{rbfadv}
and it has been parallelized in a variety of research papers \citep{rbfpar1,rbfpar2}.
This model has been extended by various researchers in tasks such
as creating new initialization techniques for the network parameters,\textbf{
}\citep{rbfinit1,rbfinit2,rbfinit3}, pruning techniques\textbf{ }\citep{rbfprun1,rbfprun2,rbfprun3},
construction of RBF networks \citep{rbfcon1,rbfcon2,rbfcon3} etc. 

In this work, a hybrid technique is proposed for the optimal calculation
of the parameters of an RBF network. This technique consists of two
phases. During the first phase, information is collected from the
training data of the neural network and an attempt is made to identify
a small interval of values for the neural network parameters. To identify
this interval, an optimization method is used, which gradually creates
the optimal value interval, which is estimated to give the lowest
value for the training error of the network. To locate the optimal
interval, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is used
\citep{psoTutorial}. The PSO method was chosen for the first phase
because it is fast and flexible enough for optimization problems,
does not require a large number of parameters to be input by the user,
and has been successfully used in a variety of problems such as flow
shop scheduling \citep{psoApp1}, developing charging strategies for
electric vehicles \citep{psoApp2}, emotion recognition \citep{psoApp3},
robot trajectory planning \citep{psoApp4} etc. The detection of the
value interval is performed in order to then make the minimization
of the network error faster and more efficient in the second phase
optimization method. In the second phase, the parameters of the neural
network are optimized within the optimal value interval of the first
phase. The optimization can be performed by any global optimization
method \citep{goReview}. In this work, the genetic algorithms \citep{ga1,ga2,ga3}
were chosen for the second phase. The main advantages of genetic algorithms
are tolerance on errors, easy to implement in parallel, efficient
exploration of the search space etc. 

Recently, many work has been appeared to tune the parameters of machine
learning models, such as the work of Agarwal and Bhanot \citep{rbftune}
for the adaptation of the RBF parameters, the incorporation of an
improved ABC algorithm to adapt the parameters of RBF networks \citep{rbfABC},
the usage of the Firefly algorithm for optimization \citep{fireflyMain}
along with machine learning models for Cervical cancer diagnosis \citep{fireflyCancer},
adaptation of CNN and XGBOOST models by an optimization algorithm
for COVID-19 diagnosis \citep{hybridCNN} etc.

The rest of this article is organized as follows: in section \ref{sec:Method-description}
the two phases of the proposed method are thoroughly discussed, in
section \ref{sec:Experiments} the experimental datasets are listed
as well as the experimental results and finally in section \ref{sec:Conclusions}
some conclusions are presented.

\section{Method description\label{sec:Method-description}}

The training error of the RBF network is expressed as: 
\begin{equation}
E(y(x,g))=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\left(y\left(x_{i},g\right)-t_{i}\right)^{2}\label{eq:eqrbf}
\end{equation}
The value $m$ stands for the number of patterns and the values $t_{i}$
denote the real output for the input. The vector $g$ denotes the
set of the parameters of the RBF network. Usually, RBF networks are
trained through a two-phase procedure: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item In the first phase the $k$ centers as well as the associated variances
are calculated through K-Means algorithm \citep{kmeans}. A typical
formulation of the K-Means algorithm is outlined in Algorithm \ref{alg:The-K-Means-algorithm.}.
\item In the second phase, the weight vector $\overrightarrow{w}=\left(w_{1},w_{2},\ldots,w_{k}\right)$
is estimated by solving a linear system of equations.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Set} \textbf{$W=w_{kj}$}
\item \textbf{Set} \textbf{$\Phi=\phi_{j}\left(x_{i}\right)$}
\item \textbf{Set $T=\left\{ t_{i}=f\left(x_{i}\right),i=1,..,M\right\} $. }
\item The system to be solved is identified as:\textbf{ 
\begin{equation}
\Phi^{T}\left(T-\Phi W^{T}\right)=0
\end{equation}
}With solution:\textbf{
\begin{equation}
W^{T}=\left(\Phi^{T}\Phi\right)^{-1}\Phi^{T}T=\Phi^{\dagger}T\label{eq:eqoutput}
\end{equation}
}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
The proposed work uses two computational phases to optimally calculate
the network parameters. Firstly, a promising range for the parameters
of the network is calculated through an optimization process that
incorporates interval arithmetic. Subsequently, the parameters of
the network are trained with the usage of a genetic algorithm inside
the located range of the first phase. The following subsections analyze
both of these phases in detail.

\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{EndFor}
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Compute} the variances for every center as 
\[

\]
\item \textbf{Terminate }if there is no change in centers $c_{j}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}


\subsection{Preliminaries }

In order to perform interval arithmetic on RBF networks the following
definitions are introduced:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The comparison of two intervals $W=\left[w_{1},w_{2}\right]$, $Z=\left[z_{1},z_{2}\right]$
is performed through the function 
\begin{eqnarray}
L^{*}(W,Z) & = & \begin{cases}
\mbox{TRUE}, & w_{1}<z_{1},\mbox{OR\ \ensuremath{\left(w_{1}=z_{1}\ \mbox{AND}\ w_{2}<z_{2}\right)}}\\
\mbox{FALSE}, & \mbox{\mbox{OTHERWISE}}
\end{cases}\label{eq:eql}
\end{eqnarray}
\item The function $E(y)$ (equation \ref{eq:eqrbf}) is modified to an
interval one $\left[E_{\mbox{min}}(y),E_{\mbox{max}}(y)\right]$ calculated
with the procedure given in Algorithm \ref{alg:Fitness-calculation-for}.
\end{enumerate}
In the proposed algorithm, the RBF network contains $n$ variables,
where
\begin{equation}
n=(d+2)\times k
\end{equation}
 The value of $n$ is calculated as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Every center $\overrightarrow{c_{i}},\ i=1,..,k$ has $d$ variables,
which means $d\times k$ variables.
\item For every center, a separate value $\sigma_{i}$ is used for the Gaussian
processing unit, which means $k$ variables.
\item The output weight $\overrightarrow{w}$ also has $k$ variables.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Fitness calculation for the modified PSO algorithm.\label{alg:Fitness-calculation-for}}

The fitness calculation for a given particle $g$ has as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Take} $N_{S}$ random samples in $g$.
\item \textbf{Calculate }$E_{\min}\left(g\right)=\min_{g_{i}\in N_{S}}\left(\left(\sum_{j=1}^{M}y\left(x_{j},g_{i}\right)-t_{j}\right)^{2}\right)$.
\item \textbf{Calculate} $E_{max}\left(g\right)=\max_{g_{i}\in N_{S}}\left(\left(\sum_{j=1}^{M}y\left(x_{j},g_{i}\right)-y_{j}\right)^{2}\right)$
\item \textbf{Return} $f_{g}=\left[E_{min}(g),E_{max}(g)\right].$
\end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}


\subsection{The proposed PSO algorithm\label{subsec:The-proposed-PSO}}

During this phase, arithmetic interval techniques are used to locate
a range for the parameters of the RBF network. The interval techniques
\citep{interval0,interval1,interval2} are a common method in global
optimization with various applications \citep{interval_app1,interval_app2,interval_app3}.
The first phase aims to locate the most promising bounding box for
the $n$ parameters of the corresponding RBF network. The initial
bounding box is defined as\textbf{ $S$ }which is a subset of $\mathbb{R^{\mbox{n}}}$:\textbf{
\begin{equation}
S=\left[a_{1},b_{1}\right]\otimes\left[a_{2},b_{2}\right]\otimes\ldots\left[a_{n},b_{n}\right]\label{eq:eq2}
\end{equation}
}The interval method of the first phase divides the set $S$ subsequently
by discarding areas that are not promising enough to contain the global
minimum. In order to locate the best interval for equation \ref{eq:eq2},
a modified PSO algorithm \citep{pso1} is used. The proposed variant
of the PSO method is based on the original technique (algorithm 1
of\citep{pso1} ) but the particles are intervals of values and at
each iteration a normalization of the velocity vector takes place
to avoid generating particles outside the original range of values.\textbf{
}The PSO method is based on a population of candidate solutions, which
in most cases are called particles. The method is based on two vectors:
the current location of particles denoted as $\overrightarrow{p}$
and the velocity of their movement denoted as $\overrightarrow{u}$.
The PSO method finds the global minimum by moving the particles based
on their previous best position as well as the best position of the
total population of particles. 

The initial bounding boxes for the centers and variances of the RBF
network are constructed using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Subsequently,
the initial values for the intervals $\left[a_{i},b_{i}\right]$ are
calculated through the algorithm \ref{alg:initialValues}. The values
for the intervals of the first $(d+1)\times k$ variables are obtained
as a multiple of the positive quantity $F$ with the values obtained
by the K-Means. The value $B$ is used to initialize the intervals
for the output weight $\overrightarrow{w}$. Afterwards, the following
PSO variant is executed:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Set} $N_{c}$ as the amount of particles.
\item \textbf{Set} the normalization factor $\lambda$.
\item \textbf{Set} the $k$ weights of the RBF network.
\item \textbf{Set} $N_{g}$ the maximum generations allowed.
\item \textbf{Set} $N_{s}$ the number of random samples that will be used
in the fitness calculation algorithm.
\item \textbf{Set} $f^{*}=\left[\infty,\infty\right]$, the fitness of the
best located particle $p^{*}$.
\item \textbf{Construct} $S=\left[a_{1},b_{1}\right]\otimes\left[a_{2},b_{2}\right]\otimes\ldots\left[a_{n},b_{n}\right]$,
as obtained from the previous two algorithms.
\item \textbf{Initialize} the $N_{c}$ particles. Each particle $p_{i},\ i=1,...,N_{c}$
is considered as a set of intervals randomly initialized in $S$.
The layout of each particle is graphically presented in Figure \ref{fig:The-layout-of}.
\item \textbf{For} $i=1,...,N_{c}$ \textbf{do }
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Calculate} the fitness $f_{i}$ of particle $p_{i}$ using
the procedure outlined in Algorithm \ref{alg:Fitness-calculation-for}.
\item \textbf{If} $L^{*}\left(f_{i},f^{*}\right)=\mbox{TRUE}$ \textbf{then}
$f^{*}=f_{i},\ p^{*}=p_{i}$
\item \textbf{Set} $p_{b,i}=p_{i},\ f_{b,i}=f_{i}$ the best located position
for particle $i$ and the associated fitness value.
\item \textbf{For} $j=1,...,n$ \textbf{do}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Set} $\delta$ the width of interval $p_{ij}$
\item \textbf{Set} $u_{ij}=\left[-r\frac{\delta}{20},r\frac{\delta}{20}\right]$,
with $r$ a random number in $[0,1]$. The velocity is initialized
to a small sub-interval of the range of values for the corresponding
parameter in order to avoid, as far as possible, excessive values
for the velocity. This would result in the particles moving out of
their value range very quickly and thus making the optimization process
difficult.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{EndFor}
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{EndFor}
\item \textbf{Set} iter=0
\item \textbf{Calculate} the inertia value as $\omega=\omega_{\mbox{max}}-\frac{\mbox{iter}}{N_{g}}\left(\omega_{\mbox{max}}-\omega_{\mbox{min}}\right)$where
common values for these parameters are $\omega_{\mbox{min}}=0.4$
and $\omega_{\mbox{max}}=0.9$. Many inertia calculations appeared
in the relevant literature such as constant inertia \citep{psoConstant},
linearly decreasing inertia \citep{psoLinear}, exponential inertia
\citep{psoExp}, random inertia calculation \citep{psoRandom}, dynamic
inertia \citep{psoDynamic}, fuzzy inertia calculation \citep{psoFuzzy}
etc. The present method of calculating the inertia was chosen because
it decreases linearly with time and for large values of the inertia
it allows a wider search in the search space and for low values it
allows a more focused search.
\item \textbf{For} $i=1,...,N_{c}$ \textbf{do \label{enu:For--do}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Calculate} the new velocity $u_{i}=\omega u_{i}+r_{1}c_{1}\left(p_{b,i}-p_{i}\right)+r_{2}c_{2}\left(p^{*}-p_{i}\right)$,
where $r_{1},r_{2}$ are random numbers in $[0,1]$ and the constant
values $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ stand for the cognitive and the social
parameters correspondingly. Usually, the values for $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$
are in $[1,2]$.
\item \textbf{Normalize} the velocity as: $u_{i}=\frac{1}{\lambda}u_{i}$,
where $\lambda$ a positive number with $\lambda>1$.
\item \textbf{Update} the position $p_{i}=p_{i}+u_{i}$
\item \textbf{Calculate} the fitness $f_{i}$ of particle $p_{i}$

\subsection{Optimization of parameters through genetic algorithm}

During the second phase of the proposed method, a genetic algorithm
is performed, which optimizes the parameters of the RBF network within
the optimal interval calculated in the first phase. The used genetic
algorithm has its roots in the $\mbox{GA}\left(c_{r1},l\right)$ algorithm
from the paper of Kaelo and Ali \citep{kaelo}. This method is enhanced
using the stopping rule suggested by Tsoulos \citep{Tsoulos1}. This
genetic algorithm has the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Initialization Step}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Set} as $N_{c}$ the number of chromosomes. Every chromosome
is coded as in case of PSO using the scheme of Figure \ref{fig:The-layout-of}.
\item \textbf{Set} as $N_{g}$ the maximum number of generations allowed.
\item \textbf{Set} $k$ the weight number of the RBF network.
\item \textbf{Obtain} the domain range $S$ from the procedure of subsection
\ref{subsec:The-proposed-PSO}.
\item \textbf{Initialize} the $N_{C}$ randomly in $S$. 
\item \textbf{Define} the selection rate $p_{s}\in[0,1]$
\item \textbf{Define} the mutation rate $p_{m}\in[0,1]$ 
\item \textbf{Set} iter=0
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Evaluation Step}

\textbf{For} every chromosome $g$ \textbf{calculate }the associated
fitness value $f_{g}=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\left(y\left(x_{i},g\right)-t_{i}\right)^{2}$
\item \textbf{Genetic operations step}\\
Perform the genetic operations of selection, crossover and mutation.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Selection procedure.} First, the population of chromosomes
is sorted based on the associated fitness values. The first $\left(1-p_{s}\right)\times N_{c}$
chromosomes are copied unchanged to the next generation, while the
rest are replaced by offsprings constructed by the crossover procedure.
During the selection step, a series of mating pairs are chosen using
the well - known procedure of tournament selection for each parent. 
\item \textbf{Crossover procedure}: For each pair $(z,w)$ of chosen parents
two new offsprings $\tilde{z}$ and $\tilde{w}$ are constructed with
the steps:
\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde{z_{i}} & = & a_{i}z_{i}+\left(1-a_{i}\right)w_{i}\nonumber \\
\tilde{w_{i}} & = & a_{i}w_{i}+\left(1-a_{i}\right)z_{i}\label{eq:crossover_ali-1}
\end{eqnarray}
where $a_{i}$ is a random number with $a_{i}\in[-0.5,1.5]$ \citep{kaelo}. 
\item \textbf{Mutation procedure}:\textbf{ }For every element of each chromosome
pick a random number $r\in[0,1]$.\textbf{ IF} $r\le p_{m}$, then
alter randomly the corresponding element.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Termination Check Step}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Set} $iter=iter+1$ 
\item \textbf{If }the termination criteria are hold then \textbf{Terminate}
\textbf{else Goto} Evaluation Step.
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{enumerate}
The overall process of the two phases can be graphically shown in
Figure \ref{fig:Graphical-representation-of}.

\subsection{Experimental results}

The RBF network for the tests was coded in ANSI C++ with the help
of the freely available Armadillo library \citep{Armadillo}. In addition,
in order to have greater reliability in the experimental results,
a 10-fold validation technique was used. All the experiments were
executed 30 times with different seeds for the random generator each
time and the average was measured. For the classification datasets,
the average classification error was reported and for the regression
datasets the mean test error. The machine used for the experiments
was an AMD Ryzen 5950X with 128GB of RAM. The used operating system
was Debian Linux. In order to accelerate the training process, the
OpenMP library was incorporated \citep{openmp}. The experimental
settings are listed in the Table \ref{tab:Experimental-parameters}.
The experimental results for the classification datasets are listed
in Table \ref{tab:Experiments-for-classification} and for the regression
datasets in Table \ref{tab:experiments-regression}. For the experimental
tables the following are applied:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The column NN-PROP indicates the application of the Rprop method \citep{rpropnn}
in an artificial neural network \citep{nn1,nn2} with 10 hidden nodes.
The RPROP method is coded in the FCNN software package \citep{fcn}. 
\item The column NN-GENETIC denotes the application of a genetic algorithm
in the artificial neural network with 10 hidden nodes. The parameters
of the used genetic algorithm are the same as in the second phase
of the proposed method.
\item The column RBF-KMEANS denotes the classic training method for RBF
networks by estimating centers and variances through K-Means and the
output weights by solving a linear system of equations.
\item The column IRBF-100 denotes the application of the current method
with $\lambda=100$.
\item The column IRBF-1000 denotes the application of the current method
with $\lambda=1000$.
\item In both tables an extra line has been added, in which the mean error
for each method is shown. This row is denoted by the name AVERAGE.
This line also shows the number of times the corresponding method
achieved the best result. This number is shown in parentheses.
\end{enumerate}
As one can see from the experimental results, the proposed method
significantly outperforms the other techniques in the majority of
cases in terms of the average error in the test set. Moreover, the
difference from the established method of training RBF networks is
of the order of 40\% and in some cases this percentage can be doubled.
The statistical difference of the proposed technique against the rest
is also shown in graphs \ref{fig:class_error} and \ref{fig:graph_regression}.
However, the proposed technique is significantly slower than the original
training technique, as it is a two-stage technique. In the first stage,
an optimal interval of values for the network parameters is created
with a modified PSO method, and in the second stage, the network is
trained using a genetic algorithm. Of course, this extra time can
be significantly reduced by incorporating parallel techniques, as
was done experimentally using the OpenMP library. Furthermore, changing
the normalization factor $\lambda$ from 100 to 1000 did not have
much effect on the mean error in the test set. This induces that the
proposed method is quite robust, since it doesn't have much dependence
on this parameter. 

An additional experiment was performed with different values for the
parameter $F$. The experimental results for this experiment are shown
in Table \ref{tab:expsFClass} for the classification datasets and
in Table \ref{tab:expsFRegression} for the regression datasets. And
for this critical parameter, no large deviations appear in the results
of the proposed method. This further enhances the robustness and reliability
of the proposed technique.

Also, in the Table \ref{tab:precisionRecall}, the metrics of precision,
recall and f-score are shown for a series of classification datasets
and for the proposed method (mentioned as IRBF-100) and the classic
method for training RBF networks (mentioned as RBF-KMEANS) .And in
these experimental results, the reader can see the superiority of
the proposed technique over the traditional method of training RBF
networks.

\section{Conclusions\label{sec:Conclusions}}

In the present work, a two-stage hybrid method was proposed to efficiently
identify the parameters of RBF neural networks. In the first stage
of the method, a technique rooted in particle swarm optimization was
used to efficiently identify a reliable interval of values for the
neural network parameters. In the second stage of the method, an intelligent
global optimization technique was used to locate the neural network
parameters within the optimal value interval of the first stage. In
this work, a genetic algorithm was used in the second phase, but any
global optimization method could be used in its place.

The method was applied to a multitude of classification and regression
problems from the relevant literature. In almost all cases, the proposed
method significantly outperforms other machine learning models, and
on average the improvement in the error on the test sets was of the
order of 40\% relative to the established RBF training method. Moreover,
the method is quite robust with respect to the basic parameters since
any changes in the parameter values do not significantly affect its
performance. Furthermore, the method can efficiently locate the value
interval of network parameters without any prior knowledge about the
type of training data or whether it is a classification or a regression
problem. However, the proposed technique is significantly more time-consuming
than the traditional training technique as it requires computational
time for both its phases. Although, this effect can be overcomed to
some extent by the use of modern parallel computing techniques.

The method could be extended by the use of other techniques of training
the parameters in RBF networks, such as, for example, the differential
evolutionary method \citep{dePaper}. Furthermore, more efficient
methods of terminating the first stage of the method could be used
as finding a suitable interval of values for the network parameters
requires many numerical calculations.
