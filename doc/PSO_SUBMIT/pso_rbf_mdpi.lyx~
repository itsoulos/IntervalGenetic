% For posting an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use "preprints" as the journal and change "submit" to "accept". The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

\begin_layout Abstract
The present paper proposes a two-phase technique for training Radial Basis
 Functions neural networks.
 During the first phase, a hybrid algorithm combining interval techniques
 and particle swarm optimization is used to detect the initialization interval
 of the neural network parameters.
 During the second phase, a hybrid algorithm that conjuncts particle swarm
 optimization and local minimization is used to train the neural network
 within the space identified in the first phase.
 This technique is tested on a number of regression and classification datasets
 from the associated literature.

Regression and data classification are two major categories of problems
 that are solved with machine learning techniques.
 Such problems appear regularly in scientific areas such as physics

 A programming tool that is used quite often to handle such problems is
 the Radial Basis Function (RBF) artificial neural network 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 An RBF networks can be expressed as a function:
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y\left(\overrightarrow{x}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{k}w_{i}\phi\left(\left\Vert \overrightarrow{x}-\overrightarrow{c_{i}}\right\Vert \right)\label{eq:firstrbf}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\series default
The following applies to the above equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x}$
\end_inset

 is the input pattern to the equation.
 The number of values in this vector is denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{c_{i}},\ i=1,..,k$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{w}$

 is considered as the output weight of the RBF network.

The value

\begin_layout Standard
Typically, the Gaussian function can bed used as the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(x)$
\end_inset

 and it defined as:
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\phi(x)=\exp\left(-\frac{\left(x-c\right)^{2}}{\sigma^{2}}\right)
\end{equation}

 As it is observed, the value of the function decreases as we move away

 In the current work, a hybrid technique is proposed for the optimal calculation
 of the parameters of an RBF network.
 This technique consists of two phases: during the first phase a range of
 values for the network parameters is estimated using an interval technique,
 guided by a Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO).
 In the second phase, the network parameters are optimized within the optimal
 value interval of the first phase using a genetic algorithm.
