\begin_layout Abstract
Artificial neural networks are widely established models used in a variety of real - world problems derived from physics,
 chemistry etc.
 These machine learning models contain a series of parameters that must be appropriately tuned by various optimization techniques in order to be effective in the problems they face.
 Genetic algorithms have been used in many cases in the recent literature to train artificial neural networks and various modifications have been introduced to enhance this procedure.
 In this article,
 the incorporation of a novel genetic operator in genetic algorithms is proposed in order to effectively train artificial neural networks.
 The new operator is based on the differential evolution technique and it is periodically applied to randomly selected chromosomes from the genetic population.
 Furthermore,
 to find a promising range of values for the parameters of the artificial neural network,
 an additional genetic algorithm is executed before the execution of the basic algorithm.
 The modified genetic algorithm was used to train neural networks for classification and regression datasets and the results are reported and compared against other methods that train neural networks.

,
 which are parametric models commonly defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x}$
\end_inset

 stands for the input pattern and the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{w}$
\end_inset

 represents the associated set of parameters that should be calculated by any optimization method.
 The calculation is performed by minimizing the so - called training error,
 expressed as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x}_{i},\overrightarrow{w}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The values 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},y_{i}\right),\ i=1,...,M$
\end_inset

 form the training set of the problem,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$

 represent the expected outputs for each pattern

 finding the optimal architecture of an artificial neural network can effectively contribute to its training,

This paper proposes the usage of a two-stage technique for the efficient training of artificial neural networks.
 In the first stage,
 a genetic algorithm is used to efficiently identify a range of values within which the parameters of the artificial neural network should be optimized.
 In the second stage,
 a genetic algorithm optimizes these parameters,
 which uses a new operator to enhance its results.
 This new operator is based on the differential evolution technique 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "de_review"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and is applied periodically to randomly selected chromosomes of the genetic population.
 The first stage of the technique is necessary to ensure that the parameters of the artificial neural network will be trained within a range of values,
 which will prevent their overfitting as much as possible.
 In the second stage,
 the differential evolution method was selected as the base of the new operator.
 This method is an evolutionary technique widely used in a series of practical problems,
 such as community detection

The two phases of the proposed method are analyzed in detail in this section.
 During the first phase a genetic algorithm is utilized in order to detect a promising interval of values for the parameters of neural network.
 In the second phase a genetic algorithm that incorporates the suggested operator is applied to minimize the training error of the neural network and the parameters are initialized inside the interval located during the first phase.

The first phase of the proposed method 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first phase of the proposed technique,
 a genetic algorithm is used to identify a range of values for the parameters of the artificial neural network.
 Genetic algorithms are evolutionary methods,
 where a series of randomly created candidate solutions,
 those called chromosomes,
 are evolved ireratively through a series of steps similar to natural processes such as selection,
 crossover and mutation.
 Genetic algorithms have been used successfully in a series of real - world problems,
 such as placement of wind turbines

 The neural networks adopted in this manuscript have the following form,
 as proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{H}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)}\sigma\left(\sum_{j=1}^{d}x_{j}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)+j}+w_{(d+2)i}\right)\label{eq:nn}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Where the value 
\begin_inset Formula $H$

 denotes the total number of processing units in this network and the value 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 defines the number of inputs for the pattern

 Hence,
 the total number of parameters for this network are:
 
\begin_inset Formula $n=(d+2)H$

The second phase of the proposed method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the second phase a second genetic algorithm is used to minimize the training error of the neural network.
 The parameters of the neural network are initialized inside the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{*}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{*}$
\end_inset

 produced in the previous phase of the algorithm.
 Also,
 a novel stochastic genetic operator,
 which is based on the Differential Evolution approach,
 is applied periodically to the genetic population.
 This new stochastic operator is used to improve the performance of randomly selected chromosomes and to speed up the overall genetic algorithm in finding the global minimum.

Experimental results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The code used in the conducted experiments was written in ANSI C++ and all runs were performed 30 times using a different seed for the random number generator each time.
 The validation of the experiments were done using the well - known method of 10 - fold cross validation.
 All the experiments were conducted on an AMD RYZEN 5950X machine with 128GB of ram running Debian Linux.
 For the case of classification datasets the average classification error is reported in the experimental tables.
 This error is calculated through the following equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{C}\left(N(w,x)\right)=100\times\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\left(\mbox{class}\left(N\left(w,x_{i}\right)\right)-y_{i}\right)}{K}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the set 
\begin_inset Formula $T=\left\{ x_{i},y_{i}\right\} ,\ i=1,\ldots,K$
\end_inset

 denotes the test set of the objective problem.
 For regression datasets the average regression error as calculated on the test set is reported and it is denoted as:Also,
 the regression error is defined as:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{R}\left(N(w,x)\right)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\left(N\left(w,x_{i}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}}{K}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The values for the parameters of the proposed method are shown in Table

In the scientific analysis of the experimental results,
 the proposed model (PROPOSED) demonstrates statistically significant superiority over other methods (ADAM,
 BFGS,
 GENETIC,
 NEAT,
 RBF) in both classification and regression datasets.
 For classification,
 the PROPOSED model achieves a mean error rate of 20.02%,
 compared to 25.48%-33.01% for the other methods,
 with extremely low p-values (e.g.,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p=2.3\times10^{-10}$
\end_inset

 against BFGS).
 In regression,
 the model’s mean absolute error (4.64) is significantly lower than that of the comparative methods (12.8-25.12),
 with strong statistical significance 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p<10^{-5}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 However,
 in certain datasets (e.g.,
 CLEVELAND,
 FRIEDMAN),
 the model’s performance decreases,
 indicating dependence on data characteristics.

An additional experiment was performed to demonstrate the reliability of the proposed methodology.
 In this experiment,
 three different differential weight

When comparing differential weight calculation methods (FIXED,
 ADAPTIVE,
 RANDOM),
 the ADAPTIVE method shows slightly better average performance (19.91% in classification,
 4.59 in regression) compared to FIXED (20.02%,
 4.64) and RANDOM (19.97%,
 4.59).
 However,
 the differences are minimal and often statistically insignificant (e.g.,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.83$
\end_inset

for FIXED vs ADAPTIVE in classification).
 In some datasets,
 such as Lymography and HouseVotes,
 the RANDOM method outperforms others,
 highlighting the need to tailor the method to the specific problem.
 In regression,
 the only significant difference occurs between FIXED and ADAPTIVE (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.041$
\end_inset

).

\begin_layout Standard
For this experiment as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:statClassF"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

,
 the differences between FIXED and ADAPTIVE (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.83$
\end_inset

) and ADAPTIVE vs RANDOM (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.94$
\end_inset

) are not statistically significant,
 suggesting equivalent performance.
 However,
 the comparison FIXED vs RANDOM (
\begin_inset Formula $p=2.3\times10^{-10}$
\end_inset

) reveals a highly significant difference,
 likely due to the random nature of RANDOM.
 For regression datasets (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:statRegressionF"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

),
 the only significant difference occurs between FIXED and ADAPTIVE (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.041$
\end_inset

),
 while the remaining comparisons (FIXED vs RANDOM:
 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.75$
\end_inset

,
 ADAPTIVE vs RANDOM:
 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.31$
\end_inset

) lack statistical significance.

The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 significantly impacts performance,
 with higher values (
\begin_inset Formula $1.0\rightarrow4.0$
\end_inset

) correlating with improved mean error rates in both classification (
\begin_inset Formula $20.02\%\rightarrow21.00\%$
\end_inset

) and regression (
\begin_inset Formula $4.64\rightarrow5.64$
\end_inset

).
 However,
 this trend is not uniform.
 For example,
 in classification,
 Segment improves dramatically (
\begin_inset Formula $30.00\%\rightarrow35.41\%$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.0015$
\end_inset

) with increased 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

,
 while Lymography degrades (
\begin_inset Formula $28.60\%\rightarrow26.69\%$
\end_inset

).
 In regression,
 increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 introduces instability some problems (e.g.,
 TREASURY:
 
\begin_inset Formula $0.44\rightarrow1.01$
\end_inset

).
 Statistical tests confirm significant differences for higher 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 values (e.g.,
 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1.5$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $a=4.0$
\end_inset

:
 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.00065$
\end_inset

 in classification,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.0021$
\end_inset

 in regression).
\end_layout

 for classification datasets (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 comparisons between higher values of

\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $a=4.0$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.00065$
\end_inset

) show strong statistical significance,
 highlighting that increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 improves performance.
 Conversely,
 the comparison 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1.0$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1.5$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.38$

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\begin_layout Standard
The study confirms the superiority of the proposed model compared to existing methods in both classification and regression tasks.
 This superiority is evidenced by a statistically significant reduction in error,
 though the model’s performance is not entirely independent of the data.
 Instead,
 it largely depends on data characteristics such as complexity,
 stratification,
 or the presence of noise.
 This underscores the importance of tailoring models to the specificities of each problem,
 as generalization without careful consideration of specific conditions may lead to degraded results.
 Additionally,
 the choice of methods for calculating critical parameters,
 such as differential weights,
 appears to have relatively limited impact on overall performance.
 Differences between approaches (e.g.,
 FIXED,
 ADAPTIVE,
 RANDOM) are minimal and often statistically insignificant,
 indicating that model optimization may require focusing on other factors.
 At the same time,
 tuning the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 emerges as a critical factor:
 while higher values enhance accuracy in many cases,
 particularly for large or complex datasets,
 the same adjustment may introduce instability in applications where data sensitivity is high (e.g.,
 financial forecasting).
 This dual behavior highlights the need to balance flexibility and robustness during the tuning process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For future research,
 it would be valuable to explore the role of dynamic algorithms that automatically adjust the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 based on data dynamics.
 For example,
 machine learning mechanisms that analyze data variability or heterogeneity in real time could optimize the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 without human intervention,
 ensuring both stability and high performance.
 Additionally,
 the development of hybrid methods that combine the advantages of different approaches (e.g.,
 the adaptability of ADAPTIVE with the simplicity of FIXED) could create more robust solutions capable of addressing a broader range of problems.
 It is also worth investigating in depth how specific data characteristics—
such as noisy measurements,
 class imbalances,
 or lack of labeling—
affect the model’s effectiveness.
 Such analysis would aid in developing adaptive strategies for data preprocessing or augmentation.
 Furthermore,
 the generalizability of findings to more complex environments (e.g.,
 dynamic systems,
 time-series data) or different domains (e.g.,
 biomedical data,
 social networks) remains an open research area.
 Finally,
 integrating explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques,
 such as feature contribution analysis or visualization tools,
 could enhance model transparency.
 This would not only facilitate result interpretation by experts but also help identify optimal parameter-tuning practices,
 transforming the model into a more predictable and reliable tool for real-world applications.
