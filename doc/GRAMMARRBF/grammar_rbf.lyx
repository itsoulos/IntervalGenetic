\begin_layout Abstract
RBF networks are used in a variety of real-world applications such as medical
 data or signal processing problems.
 The success of these parametric models lies in the successful adaptation
 of their parameters using efficient computational techniques.
 In the current work, a method of adjusting the parameters of these networks
 using Grammatical Evolution is presented.
 Grammatical Evolution will be used to successfully discover the most promising
 range of parameter values and then the training of the parameter set will
 be achieved using a Genetic Algorithm.
 The new method was applied to a wide range of data fitting and classification
 problems, and the results were more than promising.

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y\left(\overrightarrow{x}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{k}w_{i}\phi\left(\left\Vert \overrightarrow{x}-\overrightarrow{c_{i}}\right\Vert \right)\label{eq:firstrbf}

\series bold
 
\series default
Due to the widespread usages of RBF networks but also because considerable
 computing time is often required for their effective training, in recent
 years a series of techniques have been proposed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "rbfpar1,rbfpar2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for the exploitation of parallel computing units to adjust the parameters
 of neural networks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current work proposes a two phase method for the effective adjustment
 of the parameters of RBF networks in order to minimize the so -called training
 error given by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E(y(x,g))=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\left(y\left(x_{i},g\right)-t_{i}\right)^{2}\label{eq:eqrbf}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Where the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 denotes the number of input patterns, the 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}$
\end_inset

 values represent the expected output for the input pattern 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 represents the parameter set of the RBF network.
 During the first phase an attempt is made to bound the parameter values
 to intervals in which the training error of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:eqrbf"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is likely to be significantly reduced.
 The identification of the most promising intervals for the parameters is
 performed using a technique that utilizes Grammatical Evolution
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ge1"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 First, an estimate of an interval of values for the network parameters
 is made using the Kmeans algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kmeans"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Then, with the help of Grammatical Evolution, a series of division rules
 are applied to the initial interval of values in order to find an range
 of values that significantly reduces the training error.
 During the second phase, the parameters of the RBF network can be trained
 within the optimal range found in the first phase using some global optimizatio
n method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "rbfSA,rbfPSO"

 In the proposed approach, the widely used method of genetic algorithm

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The production procedure initiates from the start symbol of the BNF grammar
 and iteratively produces programs by replacing non-terminal symbols with
 the right hand of the production rules that will be selected according
 to the value of each element in the chromosome

 In the proposed method, the BNF grammar of Figure

 was used to create a new feature from the initial features.
 The symbols that are in <> are considered as non-terminal symbols.
 The parameter N denotes the number of original features.
 Typically, a chromosome 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 in grammatical evolution is expressed as a series of binary values 0 or
 1.
 In the current work, in order to simplify the mapping procedure and to
 increase the speed of the algorithm, every element of each chromosome is
 considered as an integer in a predefined range.
 In our case, the range 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,255]$

 was used but of course, this could be easily changed.

The proposed work uses two computational phases to optimally calculate the
 network parameters.
 Firstly, a promising range for the parameters of the network is calculated
 through an optimization process that incorporates interval arithmetic.
 Subsequently, the parameters of the network are trained with the usage
 of a genetic algorithm inside the located range of the first phase.
 The following subsections analyze both of these phases in detail.

 for the parameters of the RBF network.
 The interval techniques

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The first phase aims to locate the most promising bounding box for the

 parameters of the corresponding RBF network.
 The initial bounding box is defined as

\begin_inset Formula $S$

which is a subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R^{\mbox{n}}}$

The interval method of the first phase divides the set

 The proposed variant of the PSO method is based on the original technique
 (algorithm 1 of
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 ) but the particles are intervals of values and at each iteration a normalizati

 the original range of values.

\series bold

The PSO method is based on a population of candidate solutions, which in
 most cases are called particles.
 The method is based on two vectors: the current location of particles denoted
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{p}$
\end_inset

 and the velocity of their movement denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{u}$
\end_inset

 The PSO method finds the global minimum by moving the particles based on
 their previous best position as well as the best position of the total
 population of particles.

\begin_layout Enumerate
In both tables an extra line has been added, in which the mean error for
 each method is shown.
 This row is denoted by the name AVERAGE.
 This line also shows the number of times the corresponding method achieved
 the best result.
 This number is shown in parentheses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As one can see from the experimental results, the proposed method significantly
 outperforms the other techniques in the majority of cases in terms of the
 average error in the test set.
 Moreover, the difference from the established method of training RBF networks
 is of the order of 40% and in some cases this percentage can be doubled.
 The statistical difference of the proposed technique against the rest is
 also shown in graphs 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:class_error"

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 However, the proposed technique is significantly slower than the original
 training technique, as it is a two-stage technique.
 In the first stage, an optimal interval of values for the network parameters
 is created with a modified PSO method, and in the second stage, the network
 is trained using a genetic algorithm.
 Of course, this extra time can be significantly reduced by incorporating
 parallel techniques, as was done experimentally using the OpenMP library.
 Furthermore, changing the normalization factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 from 100 to 1000 did not have much effect on the mean error in the test
 set.
 This induces that the proposed method is quite robust, since it doesn't
 have much dependence on this parameter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An additional experiment was performed with different values for the parameter
 
\begin_inset Formula $F$

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expsFRegression"
plural "false"

\end_inset

 for the regression datasets.
 And for this critical parameter, no large deviations appear in the results
 of the proposed method.
 This further enhances the robustness and reliability of the proposed technique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the metrics of precision, recall and f-score are shown for a series of
 classification datasets and for the proposed method (mentioned as IRBF-100)
 and the classic method for training RBF networks (mentioned as RBF-KMEANS)
 .And in these experimental results, the reader can see the superiority of
 the proposed technique over the traditional method of training RBF networks.
