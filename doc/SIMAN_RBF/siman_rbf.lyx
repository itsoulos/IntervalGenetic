% For posting an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use "preprints" as the journal and change "submit" to "accept". The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

\begin_layout Abstract
The Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks are an established parametric machine
 learning tool, which has been extensively utilized in data classification
 and data fitting problems.
 These specific machine learning tools have been applied in various scientific
 areas, such as problems in physics, chemistry, and medicine, with excellent
 results.
 A two-step technique is usually used to adjust the parameters of these
 models, which is in most cases extremely effective.
 However, it does not effectively explore the value space of the network
 parameters and often results in parameter stability problems.
 In this paper, the use of a bounding technique that explores the value
 space of the parameters of these networks using intervals generated by
 a procedure based on the Simulated Annealing method is recommended.
 After finding a promising range of values for the network parameters, a
 genetic algorithm is applied within this range of values to more effectively
 adjust its parameters.
 The new method was applied on a wide range of classification and regression
 datasets from the relevant literature and the results are reported in the
 current manuscript.
