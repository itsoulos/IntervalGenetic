\begin_layout Abstract
The Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks are an established parametric machine learning tool,
 which has been extensively utilized in data classification and data fitting problems.
 These specific machine learning tools have been applied in various scientific areas,
 such as problems in physics,
 chemistry,
 and medicine,
 with excellent results.
 A two-step technique is usually used to adjust the parameters of these models,
 which is in most cases extremely effective.
 However,
 it does not effectively explore the value space of the network parameters and often results in parameter stability problems.
 In this paper,
 the use of a bounding technique that explores the value space of the parameters of these networks using intervals generated by a procedure based on the Simulated Annealing method is recommended.
 After finding a promising range of values for the network parameters,
 a genetic algorithm is applied within this range of values to more effectively adjust its parameters.
 The new method was applied on a wide range of classification and regression datasets from the relevant literature and the results are reported in the current manuscript.

 A commonly used machine learning tool used to tackle such problems is the Radial Basis Function (RBF) network,
 expressed as the following function:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R\left(\overrightarrow{x}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{k}w_{i}\phi\left(\left\Vert \overrightarrow{x}-\overrightarrow{c_{i}}\right\Vert \right)\label{eq:firstrbf}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In this equation the following definitions are used for the symbols:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x}$
\end_inset

 represents the input pattern with 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 number of features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 stands for the number of weights of the network.
 These weights are represented by the values 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i},\ i=1,\ldots,k$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{c_{i}},\ i=1,..,k$
\end_inset

 represent the the so - called centers of the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(x)$
\end_inset

 commonly is a Gaussian function with the following definition:

\series bold

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\phi(x)=\exp\left(-\frac{\left(x-c\right)^{2}}{\sigma^{2}}\right)

 The training error of an RBF network is defined as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E\left(R\left(\overrightarrow{x}\right)\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(R\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}\label{eq:RbfError}

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},y_{i}\right),\ i=1,...,M$
\end_inset

 represents the training set of the objective problem and the values 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 are the expected outputs for every pattern

Due to the widespread use of these networks,
 several papers have been presented in recent years that study their basic characteristics.
 For example,
 Benoudjit et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 presented a discussion on kernel widths on RBF networks.
 Similarly,
 Oyang et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 presented a novel method for the estimation of the kernel density.
 Moreover,
 Ros et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 proposed an automatic method for the initialization of the parameters of RBF networks.
 Furthermore,
 a variety of pruning techniques have also been proposed

 used to reduce efficiently the number of processing units of RBF networks in order to avoid the overfitting problem.
 Also,
 for the effective training of RBF networks a variety of methods has been proposed in the recent literature,
 such as the incorporation of Genetic Algorithms

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 etc.
 Furthermore,
 since there has been an extremely large spread of parallel programming techniques in recent decades,
 publications have also appeared that exploit such techniques for the efficient and fast training of the above networks

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In most cases,
 RBF networks are trained using a two-stage technique.
 In the first stage,
 the centers and variances are estimated using the K-means technique.
 In the second stage,
 a linear system is solved to find the weights of the Gaussian units.
 Although the above procedure is extremely fast,
 it cannot effectively explore the value space for the network parameters and in many cases numerical stability problems occur when solving the linear system.
 This paper proposes a three-stage method for the efficient training of RBF networks.
 In the first stage,
 an initial estimate of the centers and fluctuations of the RBF network is made using the K-means technique.
 Subsequently,
 an interval generation method based on Simulated Annealing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "siman1"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 is used to efficiently identify the optimal interval of network parameter values.
 The creation of the value interval is done within a value interval that is based on the initial estimate of the network parameters made in the first phase of the method.
 In the last phase of the proposed technique,
 a genetic algorithm is used to train the parameters of the machine learning model within the optimal value interval resulting from the second stage of the method.

\begin_layout Subsection
The second phase of the proposed method 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second phase of the algorithm,
 the value interval for the network parameters is constructed using a technique based on Simulated Annealing.
 The Simulated Annealing is an optimization procedure used in a variety of cases,
 such as resource allocation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sa_resource"
literal "false"

\end_inset

,
 portfolio problems 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

,
 energy problems 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "sa_solar"
literal "false"

\end_inset

,
 biology 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sa_biology"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 etc.
 The algorithm starts from large values \SpecialChar allowbreak
\SpecialChar allowbreak
of a factor called temperature,
 which is gradually decreased.
 For large values of temperature the algorithm performs a wide exploration of the search space and at low values \SpecialChar allowbreak
\SpecialChar allowbreak
it focuses around some minimum of the objective function.
 The Simulated Annealing variant used here minimizes interval functions denoted as:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f\left(x\right)=\left[f_{\mbox{min}}\left(x\right),f_{\mbox{max}}\left(x\right)\right]
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Also,
 in order to compare two intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $a=\left[a_{1},a_{2}\right]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b=\left[b_{1},b_{2}\right]$
\end_inset

 the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $D(a,b)$
\end_inset

 is incorporated with the following definition:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D(a,b)=\begin{cases}
\mbox{TRUE,} & a_{1}<b_{1}\ \mbox{OR}\ \left(a_{1}=b_{1}\ \mbox{AND}\ a_{2}<b_{2}\right)\\
\mbox{FALSE,} & \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}\label{eq:Comparison}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The method used below assumes that there are value intervals for the network parameters.
 The calculation of the functional values \SpecialChar allowbreak
\SpecialChar allowbreak
for such value intervals is performed using Algorithm

The algorithm starts from an initial value interval,
 which is based on the result of the first phase of the overall process.
 At each iteration it generates random value intervals that are close to the current value interval.
 If a value interval with a smaller functional value than the current one is presented it is accepted,
 otherwise it will be accepted with a probability that is high for large temperature values and decreases significantly as the temperature value drops.
 This means that the algorithm makes a wide exploration of the search space for high temperature values and centers around some minimum as the temperature value decreases.

Experimental results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The code used in the experiments was implemented in the C++ programming language and a machine equipped with 128GB RAM running Debian Linux was utilized in the conducted experiments.
 Each experiment was executed 30 times and the average classification error was measured for the classification datasets and the average regression error was measured for the regression datasets.
 The classification error is computed using the following equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{C}\left(R(x)\right)=100\times\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\left(\mbox{class}\left(R\left(x_{i}\right)\right)-y_{i}\right)}{K}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the set 
\begin_inset Formula $T=\left\{ x_{i},y_{i}\right\} ,\ i=1,\ldots,K$
\end_inset

 stands for the test set of the current problem and 
\begin_inset Formula $R(x)$
\end_inset

 is the RBF model.
 The regression error is calculated through the following equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{R}\left(R(x)\right)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\left(R\left(x_{i}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}}{K}

The table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:experClass"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 presents the error rates of various machine learning models (BFGS,
 ADAM,
 NEAT,
 RBF-KMEANS,
 GENRBF,
 PROPOSED) on different classification datasets.
 Each row corresponds to a dataset,
 while each column represents the error rate of a specific model.
 These values indicate the percentage of incorrect predictions,
 with lower values reflecting better performance.
 The last row of the table includes the average error rates for each model.
 Statistical analysis of the data reveals significant insights.
 The PROPOSED model exhibits the lowest average error rate (18.67%) compared to the other models,
 establishing it as the optimal choice based on the table.
 Conversely,
 the other models demonstrate higher average error rates,
 with GENRBF showing the highest average (34.64%).
 Additionally,
 significant variations in error rates across datasets are observed.
 For instance,
 in the "Circular" and "ZONF_S" datasets,
 the PROPOSED model outperforms others with very low error rates (4.19% and 1.79%,
 respectively).
 Conversely,
 in datasets like "Cleveland," the NEAT model shows a lower error rate (53.44%) compared to the PROPOSED model (50.82%).
 Notably,
 in certain datasets,
 the performance of the PROPOSED model is significantly inferior to other models.
 For example,
 in the "Alcohol" and "Z_F_S" datasets,
 the PROPOSED model exhibits much higher error rates compared to other models.
 This indicates that while the PROPOSED model generally has the lowest average error rate,
 its performance may not be consistent across all datasets.
 In conclusion,
 the PROPOSED model emerges as the best general choice for minimizing error rates,
 though its evaluation depends on the characteristics of each dataset.
 The performance differences among models highlight the need for careful model selection depending on the application.s

The table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:experRegression"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 displays the absolute error values resulting from the application of various machine learning models (BFGS,
 ADAM,
 NEAT,
 RBF-KMEANS,
 GENRBF,
 PROPOSED) on regression datasets.
 Each row corresponds to a dataset,
 while each column shows the error of a specific model.
 The last row records the average error for each model.
 Lower error values indicate better model performance.
 Analysis shows that the PROPOSED model has the lowest average error (5.48),
 making it the most efficient choice among the available models.
 The second-best model is RBF-KMEANS,
 with an average error of 9.19,
 while other models,
 such as BFGS (26.43) and ADAM (19.62),
 exhibit significantly higher error values.
 The performance of the PROPOSED model is particularly impressive in datasets such as BL,
 where its error is nearly negligible (0.0002),
 and Mortgage,
 where it has a very low error (0.14) compared to other models.
 In datasets like Stock and Plastic,
 where errors are high across all models,
 the PROPOSED model still outperforms,
 with error values of 1.53 and 2.29,
 respectively,
 compared to the other models.
 However,
 there are instances where the performance difference of the PROPOSED model relative to others is small or even unfavorable.
 For example,
 in the Laser dataset,
 the ADAM model has an error of 0.03,
 slightly higher than the PROPOSED model's 0.003,
 while in the HO dataset,
 the PROPOSED model performs better (0.01),
 but the RBF-KMEANS model is comparably close (0.03).
 In summary,
 the PROPOSED model achieves the lowest average error and the most consistent performance across most datasets,
 making it an ideal choice for regression problems.
 Nonetheless,
 certain models,
 such as RBF-KMEANS,
 may demonstrate competitive performance in specific cases,
 suggesting that model selection depends on the unique characteristics of each dataset.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

,
 reveals that the proposed model statistically significantly outperforms all other models in every comparison pair.
 Specifically,
 the p-values indicate strong statistical differences:
 PROPOSED vs BFGS 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p=10^{-8}\right)$
\end_inset

,
 PROPOSED vs ADAM 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p=6.2\times10^{-8}\right)$
\end_inset

,
 PROPOSED vs NEAT 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p=2.9\times10^{-9}\right)$
\end_inset

,
 PROPOSED vs RBF-KMEANS 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p=1.2\times10^{-6}\right)$
\end_inset

 and PROPOSED vs GENRBF 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p=1.2\times10^{-10}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 These values suggest that the proposed model is significantly better than the others with high reliability.

,
 which concerns the regression datasets,
 a similar pattern is observed,
 though the p-values are generally higher compared to the classification datasets.
 The proposed model demonstrates statistically significant superiority over the other models in all comparison pairs:
 PROPOSED vs BFGS (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.00011$

 and PROPOSED vs GENRBF (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.00049$

 Although the significance is not as strong as in the classification datasets,
 the proposed model's superiority remains clear.

Experiments with the perturbation factor 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to determine the stability of the proposed technique,
 another experiment was performed in which the perturbation factor 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 presented in the second stage of the proposed technique took a series of different values.
 The table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:experClassA"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 presents the error rates of the proposed machine learning model for three different values of the perturbation factor 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 (0.001,
 0.005,
 0.01) across various classification datasets.
 Each row represents a dataset,
 and the values indicate the model's error rate for each value of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 The last row includes the average error rates for each value of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 Analysis of the data shows that the smallest value of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 (0.001) achieves the lowest average error rate (18.67%),
 while the largest value (0.01) results in the highest average (19.06%).
 This suggests that the model generally performs better with smaller values of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 although the difference in averages is minimal.
 At the dataset level,
 there are cases where the model's performance is significantly affected by changes in the parameter.
 For instance,
 in the "Lymography" dataset,
 increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 from 0.001 to 0.01 leads to a significant increase in the error rate from 20.64% to 30.33%.
 A similar trend is observed in the "ZOO" dataset,
 where the error rate rises from 4.50% to 6.87% for 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0.005$
\end_inset

,
 but decreases again to 4.60% for 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0.01$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand,
 in datasets like "ZO_NF_S," the error remains unchanged at 3.63%,
 regardless of changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 Datasets such as "Z_F_S" and "ZONF_S" exhibit nonlinear behavior.
 In "Z_F_S," the error rate significantly decreases from 3.16% to 2.79% as 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 increases from 0.001 to 0.01,
 while in "ZONF_S," a similar decrease is observed from 1.79% to 1.74%.
 In conclusion,
 the analysis indicates that the perturbation factor 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 has a notable impact on the performance of the proposed model.
 Smaller values of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 are generally associated with better performance;
 however,
 the optimal value may depend on the characteristics of each dataset.
 Instances where error rates increase or decrease nonlinearly with changes in "a" suggest the need for further investigation into the tuning of "a" for specific applications.

The table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:experRegressionA"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 displays the absolute error values of the proposed machine learning model across various regression datasets for three different values of the perturbation factor 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 (0.001,
 0.005,
 0.01).
 Data analysis reveals that the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0.005$
\end_inset

 yields the lowest average error (4.92),
 while the values 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0.001$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0.01$
\end_inset

 result in slightly higher averages (5.48 and 5.13,
 respectively).
 This difference indicates that 0.005 is generally the most suitable value for the model,
 ensuring better performance in most cases.
 At the dataset level,
 the impact of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 varies.
 Some datasets,
 such as "Airfoil," "Concrete," "Dee," "HO," "Laser," "NT," "PL," "Plastic," and "Quake," show no change in error with variations in 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 as error values remain constant.
 In contrast,
 other datasets exhibit significant variations.
 For example,
 in the "Baseball" dataset,
 the error decreases from 86.19 for 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0.001$
\end_inset

 to 77.46 for 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0.005$
\end_inset

 then increases again to 81.97 for 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0.01$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly,
 in the "MB" dataset,
 the error drastically decreases from 5.49 for 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0.001$
\end_inset

 to 0.56 for 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0.005$
\end_inset

 and further to 0.48 for 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0.01$
\end_inset

.
 In datasets like "FA" and "FY," the error increases as 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 changes from 0.001 to 0.005,
 then decreases again for 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0.01$
\end_inset

.
 In the "Treasury" dataset,
 the error shows a slight decline as 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 increases.
 In conclusion,
 the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 has a significant impact on the model's performance in certain datasets,
 while in others,
 its effect is negligible.
 The lowest average error observed for 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0.005$
\end_inset

 suggests that this value is generally optimal for the model,
 though further tuning may be required for specific datasets.
 Cases with high variability in errors highlight the need for deeper analysis and optimization of the 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 parameter based on the characteristics of each dataset.

\end_inset

 presents the percentage error rates of the proposed machine learning model across various classification datasets for four different values of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 (1.5,
 3.0,
 5.0,
 10.0).
 Analyzing the data reveals that the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 influences the model's performance,
 but this effect varies by dataset.
 The lowest average error rate is observed for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=5.0$
\end_inset

 (18.58%),
 indicating that this value is generally optimal.
 For the other values,
 slightly higher average error rates are noted:
 18.88% for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=3.0$
\end_inset

 18.67% for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=10.0$
\end_inset

 and the highest rate,
 20.32%,
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1.5$
\end_inset

.
 Examining individual datasets,
 it is evident that for many of them,
 increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 improves performance,
 as reflected in reduced error rates.
 Examples include the "Ionosphere," "Wine," and "ZONF_S" datasets,
 where error rates decrease as 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 increases.
 In "Ionosphere," the error rate drops from 12.92% for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1.5$
\end_inset

 to 7.39% for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=10.0$
\end_inset

.
 In "Wine," the error rate decreases from 10.90% for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1.5$
\end_inset

 to 7.71% for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=10.0$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly,
 in "ZONF_S," the error rate steadily decreases from 2.59% for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1.5$
\end_inset

 to 1.79% for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=10.0$
\end_inset

.
 However,
 there are cases where increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 does not lead to improvement or results in higher error rates.
 For example,
 in the "Segment" dataset,
 the error rate rises from 35.81% for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1.5$

 to 40.83% for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=10.0$
\end_inset

.
 In the "Spiral" dataset,
 the error rate consistently increases from 13.28% for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1.5$
\end_inset

 to 22.52% for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=10.0$
\end_inset

.
 A similar trend is observed in the "Z_O_N_F_S" dataset,
 where the error rate rises from 46.00% for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1.5$
\end_inset

 to 46.77% for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=10.0$
\end_inset

.
 Overall,
 the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 significantly affects the model's performance,
 and the optimal value appears to be 
\begin_inset Formula $F=5.0$
\end_inset

 as evidenced by the lowest average error rate.
 However,
 the exact impact depends on the characteristics of each dataset,
 emphasizing the need to fine-tune the parameter value for specific datasets to achieve optimal performance.

Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

\end_inset

 provides the absolute error values of the proposed machine learning model across various regression datasets for four different values of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 (1.5,
 3.0,
 5.0,
 10.0).
 The data analysis shows that the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 affects the model's performance differently depending on the dataset.
 The average errors indicate that 
\begin_inset Formula $F=5.0$
\end_inset

 yields the lowest overall error (5.22),
 followed by 
\begin_inset Formula $F=3.0$
\end_inset

 with an average of 5.25.
 Higher averages are observed for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1.5$
\end_inset

 (5.52) and 
\begin_inset Formula $F=10.0$
\end_inset

 (5.48),
 suggesting that deviating from 
\begin_inset Formula $F=5.0$
\end_inset

 tends to increase error in some cases.
 Examining the datasets,
 it is evident that in several cases,
 increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 improves performance,
 reducing error rates.
 For example,
 in the "Abalone" dataset,
 the error decreases from 6.39 for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1.5$
\end_inset

 to 5.10 for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=10.0$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly,
 in the "Friedman" dataset,
 the error significantly decreases from 6.59 for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1.5$
\end_inset

 to 1.45 for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=10.0$
\end_inset

.
 In the "Laser" dataset,
 the error decreases progressively from 0.022 for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1.5$
\end_inset

 to 0.003 for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=10.0$
\end_inset

.
 Conversely,
 there are datasets where the effect of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is nonlinear or increases the error rate.
 For instance,
 in the "Housing" dataset,
 the error rises from 16.75 for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1.5$
\end_inset

 to 18.70 for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=10.0$
\end_inset

.
 In the "MB" dataset,
 there is a sharp increase in error from 0.116 for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=1.5$
\end_inset

 to 5.49 for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=10.0$
\end_inset

,
 indicating that 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 significantly impacts model performance for this dataset.
 In summary,
 the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 has varying effects on the model's performance across different datasets.
 While the average indicates that 
\begin_inset Formula $F=5.0$
\end_inset

 is the optimal choice,
 precise optimization of the parameter should be dataset-specific.
 Additionally,
 extreme parameter values may lead to significant performance degradation in certain datasets,
 as seen in examples like "MB" and "Housing."
