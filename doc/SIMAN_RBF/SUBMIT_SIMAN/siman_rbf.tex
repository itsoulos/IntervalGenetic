\abstract{The Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks are an established parametric
machine learning tool, which has been extensively utilized in data
classification and data fitting problems. These specific machine learning
tools have been applied in various scientific areas, such as problems
in physics, chemistry, and medicine, with excellent results. A two-step
technique is usually used to adjust the parameters of these models,
which is in most cases extremely effective. However, it does not effectively
explore the value space of the network parameters and often results
in parameter stability problems. In this paper, the use of a bounding
technique that explores the value space of the parameters of these
networks using intervals generated by a procedure based on the Simulated
Annealing method is recommended. After finding a promising range of
values for the network parameters, a genetic algorithm is applied
within this range of values to more effectively adjust its parameters.
The new method was applied on a wide range of classification and regression
datasets from the relevant literature and the results are reported
in the current manuscript.}

\section{Introduction}

A wide range of practical problems can be considered as classification
or regression problems. Such problems occur in areas such as physics
\citep{physics_ml1,physics_ml2}, astronomy \citep{astronomy_ml1,astronomy_ml2},
chemistry \citep{chemistry_ml1,chemistry_ml2}, medicine \citep{med_ml1,med_ml2},
economics \citep{econ_ml1,econ_ml2} etc. A commonly used machine
learning tool used to tackle such problems is the Radial Basis Function
(RBF) network, expressed as the following function:
\begin{equation}
R\left(\overrightarrow{x}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{k}w_{i}\phi\left(\left\Vert \overrightarrow{x}-\overrightarrow{c_{i}}\right\Vert \right)\label{eq:firstrbf}
\end{equation}
In this equation the following definitions are used for the symbols:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The vector $\overrightarrow{x}$ represents the input pattern with
$d$ number of features.
\item The parameter $k$ stands for the number of weights of the network.
These weights are represented by the values $w_{i},\ i=1,\ldots,k$.
\item The vectors $\overrightarrow{c_{i}},\ i=1,..,k$ represent the the
so - called centers of the network.
\item The function $\phi(x)$ commonly is a Gaussian function with the following
definition:\textbf{ }
\begin{equation}
\phi(x)=\exp\left(-\frac{\left(x-c\right)^{2}}{\sigma^{2}}\right)
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
A typical plot of the Gaussian function for $c=0,\ \sigma=1$ is depicted
in Figure \ref{fig:gaussian}. From this graph it is deduced that
the Gaussian RBF decreases regarding the distance from the $c$. The
parameter $c$ and $\sigma$ can be estimated using the K-Means algorithm
introduced by MacQueen \citep{kmeans}. The training error of an RBF
network is defined as:
\begin{equation}
E\left(R\left(\overrightarrow{x}\right)\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(R\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}\label{eq:RbfError}
\end{equation}
where $\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},y_{i}\right),\ i=1,...,M$ represents
the training set of the objective problem and the values $y_{i}$
are the expected outputs for every pattern $\overrightarrow{x_{i}}$.
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics{gaussian}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{A typical plot for the Gaussian function.\protect\label{fig:gaussian}}

\end{figure}
 RBF networks have been incorporated in various cases, such as face
recognition \citep{rbfface}, solutions of differential equations
\citep{rbfde1,rbfde2}, stock prediction \citep{rbfstock}, robotics
\citep{rbfrobotics1,rbfrobotics2}, network security \citep{rbf_dos1,rbf_dos2}
etc. 

Due to the widespread use of these networks, several papers have been
presented in recent years that study their basic characteristics.
For example, Benoudjit et al \citep{rbfkernel} presented a discussion
on kernel widths on RBF networks. Similarly, Oyang et al \citep{rbfkernel2}
presented a novel method for the estimation of the kernel density.
Moreover, Ros et al \citep{rbfinit1} proposed an automatic method
for the initialization of the parameters of RBF networks. Furthermore,
a variety of pruning techniques have also been proposed\textbf{ }\citep{rbfprun1,rbfprun2}
used to reduce efficiently the number of processing units of RBF networks
in order to avoid the overfitting problem. Also, for the effective
training of RBF networks a variety of methods has been proposed in
the recent literature, such as the incorporation of Genetic Algorithms
\citep{rbfga1,rbfga2}, usage of Particle Swam Optimization (PSO)
method \citep{rbfpso1,rbfpso2}, the usage of methods based on Differential
Evolution \citep{rbfdiff1}, etc. Furthermore, since there has been
an extremely large spread of parallel programming techniques in recent
decades, publications have also appeared that exploit such techniques
for the efficient and fast training of the above networks \citep{rbfpar1,rbfpar2}.

In most cases, RBF networks are trained using a two-stage technique.
In the first stage, the centers and variances are estimated using
the K-means technique. In the second stage, a linear system is solved
to find the weights of the Gaussian units. Although the above procedure
is extremely fast, it cannot effectively explore the value space for
the network parameters and in many cases numerical stability problems
occur when solving the linear system. This paper proposes a three-stage
method for the efficient training of RBF networks. In the first stage,
an initial estimate of the centers and fluctuations of the RBF network
is made using the K-means technique. Subsequently, an interval generation
method based on Simulated Annealing \citep{siman1} is used to efficiently
identify the optimal interval of network parameter values. The creation
of the value interval is done within a value interval that is based
on the initial estimate of the network parameters made in the first
phase of the method. In the last phase of the proposed technique,
a genetic algorithm is used to train the parameters of the machine
learning model within the optimal value interval resulting from the
second stage of the method.

The rest of this article is divided as follows: in section \ref{sec:Method-description}
the proposed method is presented in detail, in section \ref{sec:Experiments}
the used datasets as well as the conducted experiments are presented
and finally, in section \ref{sec:Conclusions} some conclusions are
discussed as well as some guidelines for improvements of the current
work.

\section{Method description\protect\label{sec:Method-description} }

In this section, a detailed presentation of the three phases of the
proposed technique is made using appropriate algorithms.

\subsection{The first phase of the proposed method }

A typical diagram of an RBF network is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:rbfDiagram}.\textbf{
}Every RBF network with $k$ weights has the following sets of parameters: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item A series of vectors $\overrightarrow{c_{i}},\ i=1,..,k$ that represent
the centers of the network. Each center has $d$ values.
\item Each Gaussian unit has an an additional parameter $\sigma_{i}$, that
corresponds to the variance of this unit.
\item The set of output weights $\overrightarrow{w}$ with $k$ values.
\end{enumerate}
Provided that the input vector $\overrightarrow{x}$ has $d$ values,
the total number of parameters of an RBF network is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
n=(d+2)\times k
\end{equation}
\textbf{ }For the determination of initial values for the centers
and variances the K-means algorithm is utilized here and it is presented
in Algorithm \ref{alg:KMEANS}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\begin{algorithm}[H]

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Initialization}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The input of the algorithm is the points $x_{i},\ i=1,\ldots,M$ belonging
to the train set of the objective problem,
\item \textbf{Define} as $k$ the number of centers.
\item \textbf{Set} $S_{j}=\{\ \}$, $j=1,\ldots,k$.
\end{enumerate}
\item Repeat
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{For} each point $x_{i},\ i=1,...,M$ \textbf{do}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Set} $j^{*}=\mbox{argmin}_{m=1}^{k}\left\{ D\left(x_{i},c_{m}\right)\right\} $.
The index $j^{*}$ denotes the nearest center for point$x_{i}$. The
function $D(x,y)$ represents the Euclidean distance.
\item \textbf{Set} $S_{j^{*}}=S_{j^{*}}\cup\left\{ x_{i}\right\} $.
\item \textbf{End For}
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{For} every center $c_{j},\ j=1..k$ \textbf{do}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Set} $M_{j}$ as the number of points in $S_{j}$
\item \textbf{Update }the center $c_{j}$ with the following equation:
\[
c_{j}=\frac{1}{M_{j}}\sum_{x_{i}\in S_{j}}x_{i}
\]
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{End} \textbf{For}
\end{enumerate}
\item The algorithm terminates when $c_{j}$ no longer changes
\item The output of the algorithm are the $\overrightarrow{c_{i}},\ i=1,..,k$
centers and the corresponding variances $\sigma_{i},\ i=1,\ldots,k$
\end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}
When this process is finished, the vector $\overrightarrow{z}$ with
the calculated parameters is formed using the function calculateZ()
described in algorithm \ref{alg:algorithmZ}.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{The used algorithm for the calculation of the initial set of parameters

\textbf{Function} calculateZ($\overrightarrow{c},\overrightarrow{\sigma},w_{0})$

\textbf{Inputs}: The initial calculated values for centers $\overrightarrow{c},$the
initial values for variances $\overrightarrow{\sigma}$ and a positive
value $w_{0}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Set} $l=1$
\item \textbf{For} $i=1,\ldots,k$ \textbf{do}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{For} $j=1,\ldots,d$ \textbf{do} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Set} $z_{l}=c_{i,j}$
\item \textbf{Set} $l=l+1$
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{End For}
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{End For}
\item \textbf{For} $i=1,\ldots,k$ do
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Set} $z_{l}=\sigma_{i}$
\item \textbf{Set} $l=l+1$
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{End For}
\item \textbf{For} $i=1,\ldots,k$ do
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Set} $z_{l}=w_{0}$, where $w_{0}$ a positive double precision
number.
\item \textbf{Set} $l=l+1$
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{End For}
\item \textbf{Return} the vector $\overrightarrow{z}$.
\item \textbf{End function}
\end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}

The layout of the vector $\overrightarrow{z}$ is outlined in Figure
\ref{fig:The-layout-of}. In this layout, the initial values of the
centers are entered at the beginning of the vector, then the initial
values for the variances are entered, and finally the initial values
for the network weights.

\end{figure}


\subsection{The second phase of the proposed method }

In the second phase of the algorithm, the value interval for the network
parameters is constructed using a technique based on Simulated Annealing.
The Simulated Annealing is an optimization procedure used in a variety
of cases, such as resource allocation \citep{sa_resource}, portfolio
problems \citep{sa_portfolio}, energy problems \citep{sa_solar},
biology \citep{sa_biology} etc. The algorithm starts from large values
\LyXZeroWidthSpace\LyXZeroWidthSpace of a factor called temperature,
which is gradually decreased. For large values of temperature the
algorithm performs a wide exploration of the search space and at low
values \LyXZeroWidthSpace\LyXZeroWidthSpace it focuses around some
minimum of the objective function. The Simulated Annealing variant
used here minimizes interval functions denoted as: 
\begin{equation}
f\left(x\right)=\left[f_{\mbox{min}}\left(x\right),f_{\mbox{max}}\left(x\right)\right]
\end{equation}
Also, in order to compare two intervals $a=\left[a_{1},a_{2}\right]$
and $b=\left[b_{1},b_{2}\right]$ the operator $D(a,b)$ is incorporated
with the following definition:
\begin{equation}
D(a,b)=\begin{cases}
\mbox{TRUE,} & a_{1}<b_{1}\ \mbox{OR}\ \left(a_{1}=b_{1}\ \mbox{AND}\ a_{2}<b_{2}\right)\\
\mbox{FALSE,} & \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}\label{eq:Comparison}
\end{equation}
The method used below assumes that there are value intervals for the
network parameters. The calculation of the functional values \LyXZeroWidthSpace\LyXZeroWidthSpace for
such value intervals is performed using Algorithm \ref{alg:fitness}.
The main steps of the method used in the second phase are shown as
a procedure in Algorithm \ref{alg:simanVariant}.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{The main steps of the proposed Simulated Annealing variant.\protect\label{alg:simanVariant}}

\textbf{Function} simanMethod$\left(\overrightarrow{z},F,T_{0},r_{T},N_{\mbox{\mbox{eps}}},a\right)$

\textbf{Inputs}: The vector $\overrightarrow{z}$ with the initial
set of parameters, the limit factor $F>1$, the initial temperature
$T_{0}$, the reduction factor for temperature $r_{T},\ r_{T}>0,\ r_{T}<1$,
the number of samples taken at every iteration denoted as $N_{\mbox{eps}}$
and $a>0$ the perturbation factor.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Construct} the bound vectors $L^{*},\ R^{*}$ using the vector
$\overrightarrow{z}$ of the first phase as follows: 
\[
\begin{array}{ccccc}
L_{i}^{*} & = & -F\times z_{i} & , & i=1,\ldots,n\\
R_{i}^{*} & = & \text{}F\times z_{i} & , & i=1,\ldots,n
\end{array}
\]
The parameter $F$ is a positive number greater than 1 and is used
as a limiting factor for the network parameters.
\item Set $k=0$
\item \textbf{Set} $x_{b}=\left[L^{*},R^{*}\right],y_{b}=\mbox{fitness}\left(L^{*},R^{*},N_{s}\right)$.
This function utilizes the function fitness() outlined in Algorithm
\ref{alg:fitness}.
\item \textbf{Set} $x_{c}=x_{b},y_{c}=y_{b}$
\item \textbf{For} $i=1,\ldots,N_{\mbox{eps}}$ \textbf{do\label{enu:forFitness}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Produce} a random sample $x_{t}=\left(L_{t},R_{t}\right)$
using the procedure of Algorithm \ref{alg:sampling} using as inputs
to the function the interval $x_{c}=\left[L_{c},R_{c}\right]$ and
the double precision number $a$.
\item \textbf{Set} $y_{t}=\mbox{fitness}\left(L_{t},R_{t},N_{s}\right)$
which calls the function provided in algorithm \ref{alg:fitness}.
\item \textbf{If} $D\left(y_{t},y_{c}\right)=\mbox{TRUE}$ \textbf{then}
\textbf{Set} $x_{c}=x_{t},y_{c}=y_{t}$
\item \textbf{Else Set $x_{c}=x_{t}$ }with probability\textbf{ $\min\left\{ 1,\exp\left(-\frac{f_{t}-f_{c}}{T_{k}}\right)\right\} $}
\item \textbf{End if}
\item \textbf{If} $D\left(x_{c},x_{b}\right)=\mbox{TRUE}$ \textbf{then}
\textbf{Set} $x_{b}=x_{c},y_{b}=y_{c}$
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{End For}
\item \textbf{Set $T_{k+1}=T_{k}r_{T}$}
\item \textbf{Set $k=k+1$.}
\item \textbf{If $T_{k}\le\epsilon$ stop }and\textbf{ return $x_{b}=\left[L_{b},R_{b}\right]$
}as the best located interval of bounds.

The algorithm starts from an initial value interval, which is based
on the result of the first phase of the overall process. At each iteration
it generates random value intervals that are close to the current
value interval. If a value interval with a smaller functional value
than the current one is presented it is accepted, otherwise it will
be accepted with a probability that is high for large temperature
values and decreases significantly as the temperature value drops.
This means that the algorithm makes a wide exploration of the search
space for high temperature values and centers around some minimum
as the temperature value decreases.

\subsection{The final phase of the proposed method}

In the last phase of the proposed procedure, a genetic algorithm is
executed to train the RBF network. The training is performed within
the optimal value interval identified in the previous phase of the
proposed procedure. The main steps of the proposed genetic algorithm
are shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:The-final-phase}.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{The final phase of the proposed method.\protect\label{alg:The-final-phase}}

\textbf{Procedure} finalPhase$\left(N_{c},N_{g},p_{s},p_{m},\left[L_{b},R_{b}\right]\right)$

\textbf{Inputs}: Number of chromosomes $N_{c},$number of generations
$N_{g}$, selection rate $p_{s}$, mutation rate $p_{m}$, the bounds
the bounds $\left[L_{b},R_{b}\right]$ of previous phase.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Initialize} the chromosomes $g_{i},\ i=1,\ldots,N_{c}$ as
random vectors inside the bounds $\left[L_{b},R_{b}\right]$ of the
second phase of the suggested algorithm.
\item \textbf{Set} $k=0$
\item \textbf{For} $i=1,\ldots,N_{c}$ \textbf{do\label{enu:fitnessCalc}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Create} the RBF network $R_{i}\left(\overrightarrow{x}\right)$using
as parameters the chromosome $g_{i}$.
\item \textbf{Calculate} the corresponding fitness value $f_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{M}\left(R_{i}\left(\overrightarrow{x_{j}}\right)-y_{j}\right)^{2}$
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{End For}
\item \textbf{Selection procedure}. The $p_{s}\times N_{c}$ best chromosomes
with the lowest fitness values are copied intact to the next generation.
The remaining chromosomes will be replaced by new chromosomes produced
in crossover and mutation procedure.
\item \textbf{Crossover procedure}. During the application of crossover,
pairs of chromosomes are chosen from the current population with tournament
selection. For every pair $(z,w)$ of parents two new chromosomes
$\tilde{z}$ and $\tilde{w}$ are will be produced using the following
equations:
\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde{z_{i}} & = & a_{i}z_{i}+\left(1-a_{i}\right)w_{i}\nonumber \\
\tilde{w_{i}} & = & a_{i}w_{i}+\left(1-a_{i}\right)z_{i}\label{eq:crossover_ali-1}
\end{eqnarray}
where $i=1,\ldots,n$ and $a_{i}$ are randomly selected values with
$a_{i}\in[-0.5,1.5]$ \citep{kaelo}. 
\item \textbf{Mutation procedure}. For every element of each chromosome
a random number $r\in[0,1]$ is produced. This element will be altered
randomly when $r\le p_{m}$.
\item \textbf{Set} $k=k+1$
\item \textbf{If} $k<N_{g}$ \textbf{then} go to step \ref{enu:fitnessCalc}.
\item \textbf{Obtain} the best chromosome $g_{b}$ from the genetic population,
with the lowest fitness value.
\item \textbf{Create} the corresponding RBF network $R_{b}\left(\overrightarrow{x}\right)$
\item \textbf{Apply} $R_{b}\left(\overrightarrow{x}\right)$ to the corresponding
test set and measure the associated test error and \textbf{Terminate}.

\subsection{Experimental results}

The code used in the experiments was implemented in the C++ programming
language and a machine equipped with 128GB RAM running Debian Linux
was utilized in the conducted experiments. The code was written with
the assistance of the freely available GlobalOptimus optimization
environment, that can be downloaded from \url{https://github.com/itsoulos/GlobalOptimus}
(accessed on 12 April 2025). Each experiment was executed 30 times
and the average classification error was measured for the classification
datasets and the average regression error was measured for the regression
datasets. The classification error is computed using the following
equation:
\begin{equation}
E_{C}\left(R(x)\right)=100\times\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\left(\mbox{class}\left(R\left(x_{i}\right)\right)-y_{i}\right)}{K}
\end{equation}
where the set $T=\left\{ x_{i},y_{i}\right\} ,\ i=1,\ldots,K$ stands
for the test set of the current problem and $R(x)$ is the RBF model.
The regression error is calculated through the following equation:
\begin{equation}
E_{R}\left(R(x)\right)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\left(R\left(x_{i}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}}{K}
\end{equation}
The values for the parameters of the proposed method are mentioned
in Table \ref{tab:settings}. The selection of values \LyXZeroWidthSpace\LyXZeroWidthSpace for
the experimental parameters was done in such a way that there is a
compromise between the speed and reliability of the proposed methodology.
In the following tables that describe the experimental results the
following notation is used:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The column DATASET represents the name of the objective problem.

The table \ref{tab:experClass} presents the error rates of various
machine learning models (BFGS, ADAM, NEAT, RBF-KMEANS, GENRBF, PROPOSED)
on different classification datasets. Each row corresponds to a dataset,
while each column represents the error rate of a specific model. These
values indicate the percentage of incorrect predictions, with lower
values reflecting better performance. The last row of the table includes
the average error rates for each model. Statistical analysis of the
data reveals significant insights. The PROPOSED model exhibits the
lowest average error rate (18.67\%) compared to the other models,
establishing it as the optimal choice based on the table. Conversely,
the other models demonstrate higher average error rates, with GENRBF
showing the highest average (34.64\%). Additionally, significant variations
in error rates across datasets are observed. For instance, in the
\textquotedbl Circular\textquotedbl{} and \textquotedbl ZONF\_S\textquotedbl{}
datasets, the PROPOSED model outperforms others with very low error
rates (4.19\% and 1.79\%, respectively). Conversely, in datasets like
\textquotedbl Cleveland,\textquotedbl{} the NEAT model shows a lower
error rate (53.44\%) compared to the PROPOSED model (50.82\%). Notably,
in certain datasets, the performance of the PROPOSED model is significantly
inferior to other models. For example, in the \textquotedbl Alcohol\textquotedbl{}
and \textquotedbl Z\_F\_S\textquotedbl{} datasets, the PROPOSED model
exhibits much higher error rates compared to other models. This indicates
that while the PROPOSED model generally has the lowest average error
rate, its performance may not be consistent across all datasets. In
conclusion, the PROPOSED model emerges as the best general choice
for minimizing error rates, though its evaluation depends on the characteristics
of each dataset. The performance differences among models highlight
the need for careful model selection depending on the application.

Also, the average execution time for each machine learning that was
applied on the classification datasets is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:timeClass}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{simrbf_time}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{Average execution time for the machine learning methods that were
applied on the classification datasets.\protect\label{fig:timeClass}}

\end{figure}
As expected, the proposed technique requires significantly more execution
time than all the other techniques in the set, since it consists of
the serial execution of global optimization techniques. Moreover,
the method entitled as GENRBF required also significant time with
respect to other more simpler methods in the set. The additional time
required by the proposed technique can of course be significantly
reduced by the use of parallel processing techniques in its various
stages, such as for example the use of parallel Simulated Annealing
techniques \citep{parallelSA}. Moreover, Figure \ref{fig:errorRates}
depicts a comparison of error rates across models for all classification
datasets involved in the conducted experiments.

The table \ref{tab:experRegression} displays the absolute error values
resulting from the application of various machine learning models
(BFGS, ADAM, NEAT, RBF-KMEANS, GENRBF, PROPOSED) on regression datasets.
Each row corresponds to a dataset, while each column shows the error
of a specific model. The last row records the average error for each
model. Lower error values indicate better model performance. Analysis
shows that the PROPOSED model has the lowest average error (5.48),
making it the most efficient choice among the available models. The
second-best model is RBF-KMEANS, with an average error of 9.19, while
other models, such as BFGS (26.43) and ADAM (19.62), exhibit significantly
higher error values. The performance of the PROPOSED model is particularly
impressive in datasets such as BL, where its error is nearly negligible
(0.0002), and Mortgage, where it has a very low error (0.14) compared
to other models. In datasets like Stock and Plastic, where errors
are high across all models, the PROPOSED model still outperforms,
with error values of 1.53 and 2.29, respectively, compared to the
other models. However, there are instances where the performance difference
of the PROPOSED model relative to others is small or even unfavorable.
For example, in the Laser dataset, the ADAM model has an error of
0.03, slightly higher than the PROPOSED model's 0.003, while in the
HO dataset, the PROPOSED model performs better (0.01), but the RBF-KMEANS
model is comparably close (0.03). In summary, the PROPOSED model achieves
the lowest average error and the most consistent performance across
most datasets, making it an ideal choice for regression problems.
Nonetheless, certain models, such as RBF-KMEANS, may demonstrate competitive
performance in specific cases, suggesting that model selection depends
on the unique characteristics of each dataset.

The analysis of significance levels for the classification datasets,
as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:statClass}, reveals that the proposed
model statistically significantly outperforms all other models in
every comparison pair. Specifically, the p-values indicate strong
statistical differences: PROPOSED vs BFGS $\left(p=10^{-8}\right)$,
PROPOSED vs ADAM $\left(p=6.2\times10^{-8}\right)$, PROPOSED vs NEAT
$\left(p=2.9\times10^{-9}\right)$, PROPOSED vs RBF-KMEANS $\left(p=1.2\times10^{-6}\right)$
and PROPOSED vs GENRBF $\left(p=1.2\times10^{-10}\right)$. These
values suggest that the proposed model is significantly better than
the others with high reliability.

\end{figure}
In Figure \ref{fig:statRegression}, which concerns the regression
datasets, a similar pattern is observed, though the p-values are generally
higher compared to the classification datasets. The proposed model
demonstrates statistically significant superiority over the other
models in all comparison pairs: PROPOSED vs BFGS ($p=0.00011$), PROPOSED
vs ADAM ($p=0.015$), PROPOSED vs NEAT ($p=0.00016$), PROPOSED vs
RBF-KMEANS ($p=0.0016$), and PROPOSED vs GENRBF ($p=0.00049$). Although
the significance is not as strong as in the classification datasets,
the proposed model's superiority remains clear.

\subsection{Experiments with the perturbation factor $a$ }

In order to determine the stability of the proposed technique, another
experiment was performed in which the perturbation factor $a$ presented
in the second stage of the proposed technique took a series of different
values. The table \ref{tab:experClassA} presents the error rates
of the proposed machine learning model for three different values
of the perturbation factor $a$ (0.001, 0.005, 0.01) across various
classification datasets. Each row represents a dataset, and the values
indicate the model's error rate for each value of $a$. The last row
includes the average error rates for each value of $a$. Analysis
of the data shows that the smallest value of $a$ (0.001) achieves
the lowest average error rate (18.67\%), while the largest value (0.01)
results in the highest average (19.06\%). This suggests that the model
generally performs better with smaller values of $a$ although the
difference in averages is minimal. At the dataset level, there are
cases where the model's performance is significantly affected by changes
in the parameter. For instance, in the \textquotedbl Lymography\textquotedbl{}
dataset, increasing $a$ from 0.001 to 0.01 leads to a significant
increase in the error rate from 20.64\% to 30.33\%. A similar trend
is observed in the \textquotedbl ZOO\textquotedbl{} dataset, where
the error rate rises from 4.50\% to 6.87\% for $a=0.005$, but decreases
again to 4.60\% for $a=0.01$. On the other hand, in datasets like
\textquotedbl ZO\_NF\_S,\textquotedbl{} the error remains unchanged
at 3.63\%, regardless of changes in $a$. Datasets such as \textquotedbl Z\_F\_S\textquotedbl{}
and \textquotedbl ZONF\_S\textquotedbl{} exhibit nonlinear behavior.
In \textquotedbl Z\_F\_S,\textquotedbl{} the error rate significantly
decreases from 3.16\% to 2.79\% as $a$ increases from 0.001 to 0.01,
while in \textquotedbl ZONF\_S,\textquotedbl{} a similar decrease
is observed from 1.79\% to 1.74\%. In conclusion, the analysis indicates
that the perturbation factor $a$ has a notable impact on the performance
of the proposed model. Smaller values of $a$ are generally associated
with better performance; however, the optimal value may depend on
the characteristics of each dataset. Instances where error rates increase
or decrease nonlinearly with changes in \textquotedbl a\textquotedbl{}
suggest the need for further investigation into the tuning of \textquotedbl a\textquotedbl{}
for specific applications.

The table \ref{tab:experRegressionA} displays the absolute error
values of the proposed machine learning model across various regression
datasets for three different values of the perturbation factor $a$
(0.001, 0.005, 0.01). Data analysis reveals that the parameter $a=0.005$
yields the lowest average error (4.92), while the values $a=0.001$
and $a=0.01$ result in slightly higher averages (5.48 and 5.13, respectively).
This difference indicates that 0.005 is generally the most suitable
value for the model, ensuring better performance in most cases. At
the dataset level, the impact of $a$ varies. Some datasets, such
as \textquotedbl Airfoil,\textquotedbl{} \textquotedbl Concrete,\textquotedbl{}
\textquotedbl Dee,\textquotedbl{} \textquotedbl HO,\textquotedbl{}
\textquotedbl Laser,\textquotedbl{} \textquotedbl NT,\textquotedbl{}
\textquotedbl PL,\textquotedbl{} \textquotedbl Plastic,\textquotedbl{}
and \textquotedbl Quake,\textquotedbl{} show no change in error with
variations in $a$ as error values remain constant. In contrast, other
datasets exhibit significant variations. For example, in the \textquotedbl Baseball\textquotedbl{}
dataset, the error decreases from 86.19 for $a=0.001$ to 77.46 for
$a=0.005$ then increases again to 81.97 for $a=0.01$. Similarly,
in the \textquotedbl MB\textquotedbl{} dataset, the error drastically
decreases from 5.49 for $a=0.001$ to 0.56 for $a=0.005$ and further
to 0.48 for $a=0.01$. In datasets like \textquotedbl FA\textquotedbl{}
and \textquotedbl FY,\textquotedbl{} the error increases as $a$
changes from 0.001 to 0.005, then decreases again for $a=0.01$. In
the \textquotedbl Treasury\textquotedbl{} dataset, the error shows
a slight decline as $a$ increases. In conclusion, the parameter $a$
has a significant impact on the model's performance in certain datasets,
while in others, its effect is negligible. The lowest average error
observed for $a=0.005$ suggests that this value is generally optimal
for the model, though further tuning may be required for specific
datasets. Cases with high variability in errors highlight the need
for deeper analysis and optimization of the $a$ parameter based on
the characteristics of each dataset.

Figure \ref{fig:statClassA} compares different values of parameter
$a$ for the classification datasets. The p-values for the comparisons
$a=0.001$ vs $a=0.005$ ($p=0.36$), $a=0.001$ vs $a=0.01$ ($p=0.071$),
and $a=0.005$ vs $a=0.01$ ($p=0.17$) indicate that the differences
between the parameter values are not statistically significant. This
suggests that varying parameter $a$ within this range does not substantially
affect the model's performance on these datasets.

shows that the choice of parameter $a$ does not significantly influence
the model's performance on the regression datasets.

\subsection{Experiments with the parameter $F$}

Another experiment was conducted using the initialization factor $F$.
Table \ref{tab:experClassF} presents the percentage error rates of
the proposed machine learning model across various classification
datasets for four different values of the parameter $F$ (1.5, 3.0,
5.0, 10.0). Analyzing the data reveals that the parameter $F$ influences
the model's performance, but this effect varies by dataset. The lowest
average error rate is observed for $F=5.0$ (18.58\%), indicating
that this value is generally optimal. For the other values, slightly
higher average error rates are noted: 18.88\% for $F=3.0$ 18.67\%
for $F=10.0$ and the highest rate, 20.32\%, for $F=1.5$. Examining
individual datasets, it is evident that for many of them, increasing
$F$ improves performance, as reflected in reduced error rates. Examples
include the \textquotedbl Ionosphere,\textquotedbl{} \textquotedbl Wine,\textquotedbl{}
and \textquotedbl ZONF\_S\textquotedbl{} datasets, where error rates
decrease as $F$ increases. In \textquotedbl Ionosphere,\textquotedbl{}
the error rate drops from 12.92\% for $F=1.5$ to 7.39\% for $F=10.0$.
In \textquotedbl Wine,\textquotedbl{} the error rate decreases from
10.90\% for $F=1.5$ to 7.71\% for $F=10.0$. Similarly, in \textquotedbl ZONF\_S,\textquotedbl{}
the error rate steadily decreases from 2.59\% for $F=1.5$ to 1.79\%
for $F=10.0$. However, there are cases where increasing $F$ does
not lead to improvement or results in higher error rates. For example,
in the \textquotedbl Segment\textquotedbl{} dataset, the error rate
rises from 35.81\% for $F=1.5$ to 40.83\% for $F=10.0$. In the \textquotedbl Spiral\textquotedbl{}
dataset, the error rate consistently increases from 13.28\% for $F=1.5$
to 22.52\% for $F=10.0$. A similar trend is observed in the \textquotedbl Z\_O\_N\_F\_S\textquotedbl{}
dataset, where the error rate rises from 46.00\% for $F=1.5$ to 46.77\%
for $F=10.0$. Overall, the parameter $F$ significantly affects the
model's performance, and the optimal value appears to be $F=5.0$
as evidenced by the lowest average error rate. However, the exact
impact depends on the characteristics of each dataset, emphasizing
the need to fine-tune the parameter value for specific datasets to
achieve optimal performance.

Table \ref{tab:experRegressionF} provides the absolute error values
of the proposed machine learning model across various regression datasets
for four different values of the parameter $F$ (1.5, 3.0, 5.0, 10.0).
The data analysis shows that the parameter $F$ affects the model's
performance differently depending on the dataset. The average errors
indicate that $F=5.0$ yields the lowest overall error (5.22), followed
by $F=3.0$ with an average of 5.25. Higher averages are observed
for $F=1.5$ (5.52) and $F=10.0$ (5.48), suggesting that deviating
from $F=5.0$ tends to increase error in some cases. Examining the
datasets, it is evident that in several cases, increasing $F$ improves
performance, reducing error rates. For example, in the \textquotedbl Abalone\textquotedbl{}
dataset, the error decreases from 6.39 for $F=1.5$ to 5.10 for $F=10.0$.
Similarly, in the \textquotedbl Friedman\textquotedbl{} dataset,
the error significantly decreases from 6.59 for $F=1.5$ to 1.45 for
$F=10.0$. In the \textquotedbl Laser\textquotedbl{} dataset, the
error decreases progressively from 0.022 for $F=1.5$ to 0.003 for
$F=10.0$. Conversely, there are datasets where the effect of $F$
is nonlinear or increases the error rate. For instance, in the \textquotedbl Housing\textquotedbl{}
dataset, the error rises from 16.75 for $F=1.5$ to 18.70 for $F=10.0$.
In the \textquotedbl MB\textquotedbl{} dataset, there is a sharp
increase in error from 0.116 for $F=1.5$ to 5.49 for $F=10.0$, indicating
that $F$ significantly impacts model performance for this dataset.
In summary, the parameter $F$ has varying effects on the model's
performance across different datasets. While the average indicates
that $F=5.0$ is the optimal choice, precise optimization of the parameter
should be dataset-specific. Additionally, extreme parameter values
may lead to significant performance degradation in certain datasets,
as seen in examples like \textquotedbl MB\textquotedbl{} and \textquotedbl Housing.\textquotedbl{}

In Figure \ref{fig:statClassF}, which compares different values of
parameter $F$ for the classification datasets, several statistically
significant differences are observed. The p-values for the comparisons
$F=1.5$ vs $F=3.0$ ($p=0.00019$), $F=1.5$ vs $F=5.0$ ($p=0.00012$),
and $F=1.5$ vs $F=10.0$ ($p=0.00069$) indicate a strong difference
in the model's performance. In contrast, the values for the comparisons
$F=3.0$ vs $F=5.0$ ($p=0.027$), $F=3.0$ vs $F=10.0$ ($p=0.062$),
and $F=5.0$ vs $F=10.0$ ($p=0.23$) show that the differences between
larger values of parameter $F$ are less significant.

\section{Conclusions \protect\label{sec:Conclusions}}

The article focuses on optimizing the parameter tuning process in
Radial Basis Function networks through a multidimensional and innovative
approach that combines techniques such as Simulated Annealing and
genetic algorithms. The proposed method surpasses traditional two-stage
approaches, where parameters are typically determined using fixed
processes like K-means clustering followed by a split between training
and validation phases. Instead, the article introduces a three-phase
process. In the first phase, initial parameter estimation is performed
using K-means, ensuring a stable starting point. In the second phase,
the application of Simulated Annealing provides an advanced mechanism
for exploring the parameter space, avoiding local minima and examining
a broader range of potential values. Finally, the third phase integrates
genetic algorithms, enabling the optimization of parameters based
on the model's actual performance. This process ensures a comprehensive
and adaptive approach, reducing the likelihood of overfitting and
numerical instability. The novelty of the method lies not only in
the three-phase process but also in the model's ability to adapt to
datasets with diverse characteristics, such as those involving complex
nonlinear relationships or multidimensional dependencies. Experimental
results demonstrate the method's superiority compared to traditional
techniques, such as BFGS, ADAM, NEAT, and RBF-KMEANS, achieving improvements
in terms of average error rates across both classification and regression
datasets.

The article's conclusions clearly highlight the superiority of the
proposed method. In classification datasets, the method achieves lower
average error rates, particularly when parameters $a$ and $F$ are
optimally configured. For instance, in classification datasets, the
parameter $F$ significantly influences performance, with $F=5.0$
proving to be the most effective value in many cases. In datasets
such as \textquotedbl Ionosphere\textquotedbl{} and \textquotedbl Wine,\textquotedbl{}
dramatic reductions in error rates are observed as the value of $F$
increases, emphasizing the importance of selecting this parameter
correctly. Similarly, in regression datasets, the proposed model demonstrates
exceptional performance, with notable examples including datasets
like \textquotedbl Abalone\textquotedbl{} and \textquotedbl Friedman,\textquotedbl{}
where the error decreases significantly compared to traditional techniques.
The \textquotedbl MB\textquotedbl{} dataset is particularly interesting,
as the use of Simulated Annealing contributed to a substantial performance
improvement, avoiding errors commonly encountered in traditional approaches.
Despite the generally positive results, there are cases where the
method's performance is suboptimal, such as in the \textquotedbl Segment\textquotedbl{}
dataset, indicating that the method is not universally generalizable
without adjustment to the characteristics of each dataset. The need
for further research on the parameters $a$ and $F$ becomes evident,
as these parameters critically impact performance across numerous
datasets.

For the future, the article proposes numerous directions for further
exploration and development. Initially, applying the method to more
diverse data categories, such as time series, image data, or even
genetic data, could broaden its application scope. Additionally, the
dynamic adjustment of parameters $a$ and $F$ during training, using
reinforcement learning techniques, could further enhance performance
by eliminating the need for manual tuning. Furthermore, integrating
the method into deep learning systems, such as Convolutional or Recurrent
Neural Networks, could lead to hybrid approaches that combine the
flexibility of RBF with the computational power of deep neural networks.
Moreover, investigating the robustness of the method in environments
with dynamic or imbalanced data could provide additional insights
into its generalizability. Finally, analyzing the method's performance
on big data and integrating it with technologies like distributed
processing or cloud computing could open new avenues, enabling its
scalability to larger-scale problems. The methodology proposed in
the article not only sets new standards for the performance of RBF
but also paves the way for further innovation in the field of machine
learning.
