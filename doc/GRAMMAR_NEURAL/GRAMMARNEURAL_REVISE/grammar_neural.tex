\abstract{Artificial neural networks are widely established models of computational
intelligence that have been tested for effectiveness in a variety
of real-world applications. These models require fitting a set of
parameters through the use of some optimization technique. However,
an issue that researchers often face is finding an efficient range
of values for the parameters of the artificial neural network. This
paper proposes an innovative technique of generating a promising range
of values for the parameters of the artificial neural network. Finding
the value field is done by a series of rules for partitioning the
original set of values or expanding it, which rules are generated
using Grammatical Evolution. After finding a promising interval of
values, any optimization technique such as a genetic algorithm can
be used to train the artificial neural network on that interval of
values. The new technique was tested on a wide range of problems from
the relevant literature and the results were extremely promising.}

\section{Introduction}

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are widespread machine learning
models, which base their dynamics on a series of parameters which
are also called computational units or weights in the relevant literature
\citep{nn1,nn2}. Neural networks are widely used in a variety of
scientific applications, such as problems from physics \citep{nnphysics1,nnphysics2,nnphysics3},
solutions of differential equations \citep{nnde1,nnde2}, agriculture
problems \citep{nnagr1,nnagr2}, chemistry problems \citep{nnchem1,nnchem2,nnchem3},
problems that appear in the area of economic sciences \citep{nnecon1,nnecon2,nncecon3},
problems related to medicine \citep{nnmed1,nnmed2} etc. Commonly,
the neural networks are expressed as a function $N(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w})$,
with the assumption that the vector $\overrightarrow{x}$ stands for
the input vector to the neural network and the vector $\overrightarrow{w}$
is the parameter vector that should be estimated. The first vector
is called pattern in the bibliography and the second one weight vector.
Techniques that adjust the parameter vector $\overrightarrow{w}$
minimize the so-called training error, defined as:
\begin{equation}
E\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x}_{i},\overrightarrow{w}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}
In equation \ref{eq:eq1} the set $\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},y_{i}\right),\ i=1,...,M$
is denoted as the train set of the neural network. The $y_{i}$ are
considered the target outputs for the $\overrightarrow{x_{i}}$ points
. As proposed in \citep{nnc}, neural networks can be expressed as
the following summation:
\begin{equation}
N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{H}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)}\sigma\left(\sum_{j=1}^{d}x_{j}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)+j}+w_{(d+2)i}\right)\label{eq:nn}
\end{equation}
The number of processing units is denoted by $H$ and the value $d$
stands for the dimension of input vector $\overrightarrow{x}$. The
function$\ \sigma(x)$ denotes the well - known sigmoid function expressed
as: 
\begin{equation}
\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}\label{eq:sig}
\end{equation}
From the above equations one can calculated the total number of parameters
in the neural network as:
\begin{equation}
n=\left(d+2\right)H
\end{equation}
The training of neural networks has been performed by a variety of
numerical methods in recent bibliography, such as: the Back Propagation
method \citep{bpnn}, the RPROP method \citep{rpropnn-1}, the Adam
optimizer \citep{Adam} etc. Furthermore, more advanced optimization
methods have been incorporated to optimize the parameter vector of
neural networks by minimizing equation \ref{eq:eq1} such as Quasi
Newton methods \citep{quasinn},\textbf{ }the Tabu Search method \citep{tabunn},
Simulated Annealing \citep{nn_ann1}, genetic Algorithms \citep{geneticnn},
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) \citep{psonn},\textbf{ }Differential
Evolution \citep{weight_de1}, Ant Colony Optimization \citep{weight_aco}
etc. 

Also, recently a series of hybrid optimization methods have been proposed
to tackle the minimization of the training error, such as a method
that combines PSO and genetic algorithms \citep{nnhybrid1,nnhybrid2},
incorporation of a particle swarm optimization algorithm and gravitational
search algorithm \citep{nnhybrid3}, a combination of a genetic algorithm
and controlled gradient method \citep{nnhybrid4} etc.

In addition, an important topic for artificial neural networks such
as parameter initialization has been studied by several researchers
in recent years. In this area appeared papers such as initialization
with decision trees \citep{weight_init1}, incorporation of the Cauchy's
inequality \citep{weight_init2}, discriminant learning \citep{weight_init3}
etc. Also, another interesting topic in the area of neural networks
is weight decaying, where some regularization is applied to the parameters
of the neural network to avoid the overfitting problem. For this topic,
several research papers have been suggested, such as a method that
incorporates positive correlation \citep{weight_decay1}, the SarProp
algorithm \citep{weight_decay2}, usage of pruning techniques \citep{weight_decay3}
etc.

This paper proposes a two-stage method for efficient training of the
parameters of artificial neural networks. In the first stage, a value
interval is constructed for the parameters of the neural network through
Grammatical Evolution \citep{ge1}. In the first stage of this work,
after an initial estimate of the interval for the parameters of the
neural network is made, a series of rules for partitioning and expanding
the initial value interval are applied with the usage of Grammatical
Evolution, until a promising value interval is found. In the second
stage of the method, a genetic algorithm is applied to train the parameters
of the artificial neural network. Training is performed within the
optimal interval of values found in the first stage of the method.
The proposed method utilizes a genetic algorithm in the second stage
to train the neural network, but any other optimization method can
be used instead of genetic algorithms. However, genetic algorithms
are used because they are easily adaptable to many optimization problems,
they are fault tolerant and because they can be easily parallelized
using modern computing techniques.

The proposed method seeks in its first stage to find, using an evolutionary
rule technique, a range of values for the parameters of the artificial
neural networks. This interval should on the one hand be small enough
to speed up the method of the second stage that will be used to train
the model and on the other hand the artificial neural network should
have satisfactory generalization abilities within the interval of
values of the first stage.

The rest of this article is organized as follows: in section \ref{sec:Method-description}
the steps of the proposed method are outlined in detail, in section
\ref{sec:Experiments} the datasets used in the conducted experiments
as well the experimental results are presented and finally in section
\ref{sec:Conclusions} some conclusions are presented.

\section{Method description\label{sec:Method-description}}

In this section a detailed description of the Grammatical Evolution
technique is provided, accompanied by the proposed language that creates
intervals for the parameters of the neural networks.\textbf{ }Subsequently\textbf{,}
the first phase of the proposed technique is described and finally,
the second phase with the application of a genetic algorithm to the
outcome of the first phase, is thoroughly analyzed.

\subsection{Grammatical evolution }

Grammatical evolution is an evolutionary process, where the chromosomes
represent production rules of some provided BNF (Backus--Naur form)
grammar \citep{bnf1} and this\textbf{ }evolutionary process can evolve
programs in the underlying language. Grammatical Evolution has been
used successfully in many real world problems, such as function approximation\citep{ge_program1,ge_program2},
solution of trigonometric equations \citep{ge_trig}, automatic music
composition \citep{ge_music}, neural network construction \citep{ge_nn,ge_nn2},
creating numeric constraints \citep{ge_constant}, video games \citep{ge_pacman,ge_supermario},
estimation of energy demand \citep{ge_energy}, combinatorial optimization
\citep{ge_comb}, cryptography \citep{ge_crypt}, evolution of decision
trees \citep{ge_decision}, automatic design of analog electronic
circuits \citep{ge_analog} etc\textbf{. }Any BNF grammar can be described
as the set $G=\left(N,T,S,P\right)$ where
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$ is the set of the non-terminal symbols. Every symbol in $N$
has a series of production rules, used to produce terminal symbols.
\item \textbf{$T$ }is the set of terminal symbols. 
\item $S$ denotes the start symbol of the grammar, with $S\in N$.
\item $P$ is the set of production rules, to create terminal symbols non
- terminal symbols. These rules are in the form $A\rightarrow a$
or $A\rightarrow aB,\ A,B\in N,\ a\in T$.
\end{itemize}
The algorithm initiates from the symbol $S$ and iteratively produces
terminal symbols by replacing non-terminal symbols with the right
hand of the selected production rule. Every production rule is is
selected using the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Get the next element V from the current chromosome.
\item Select the next production rule according to: Rule = V mod $N_{R}$,
where $N_{R}$ is the total number of production rules for the current
non -- terminal symbol. 
\end{itemize}
The grammar used in the current work is shown in Figure \ref{fig:BNF-grammar-of}.

\caption{BNF grammar used in the current work. The value $n$ stands for the
number of total parameters in the neural network.\label{fig:BNF-grammar-of}}
\end{figure}
The symbols in \textless\textgreater{} represent the non-terminal
symbols of the grammar. The numbers in parentheses in the right part
of each rule, indicate production rule sequence numbers. In the proposed
language described by the grammar of the scheme, three distinct operations
can be applied to parameters of the artificial neural network either
on the left end of the parameter's value range (described by \textless lcommand\textgreater )
or on the right end of the value range (described by the \textless rcommand\textgreater{}
symbol). These commands are
\begin{enumerate}
\item NOTHING. This command means that no action takes place.
\item EXPAND. With this command, the corresponding end of the value field
is extended by 50\% of the width of the field.
\item DIVIDE. With this command, the corresponding end of the value field
is shrunk by 50\% of the width of the field.
\end{enumerate}
As a complete example consider a neural network with $H=2$ hidden
nodes and the dimension of the objective problem is set to $d=2$.
Hence, the total number of parameters in the neural network is $n=(d+2)H=8$.
Also, for reasons of simplicity, we consider that the initial range
of values for all parameters of the artificial neural network is the
interval {[}-2,2{]} and is denotes as a the set of intervals
\begin{equation}
I_{N}=\left\{ \left[-2,2\right],\left[-2,2\right],\left[-2,2\right],\left[-2,2\right],\left[-2,2\right],\left[-2,2\right],\left[-2,2\right],\left[-2,2\right]\right\} \label{eq:in_original}
\end{equation}
 and consider also the chromosome 
\[
x=\left[9,8,6,4,15,9,16,23,7\right]
\]
 The steps to produce the final program 
\[
p_{\mbox{test}}=(x7,\mbox{EXPAND},\mbox{NOTHING}),(x1,\mbox{DIVIDE},\mbox{EXPAND})
\]
 are shown in Table \ref{tab:table_with_steps}.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}
After the application of the program $p_{\mbox{test}}$ to the original
interval $I_{N}$ of equation \ref{eq:in_original}, the new set has
as follows:
\begin{equation}
I_{N}=\left\{ \left[-4,2\right],\left[-2,2\right],\left[-2,2\right],\left[-2,2\right],\left[-2,2\right],\left[-2,2\right],\left[0,4\right],\left[-2,2\right]\right\} 
\end{equation}


\subsection{The first phase of the proposed method \label{subsec:The-first-phase}}

Before starting the process of creating partitioning rules and expanding
the value interval of the neural network weights, an initial estimate
of this interval should be made. In the present work, only a few steps
of a genetic algorithm are applied to make an initial estimate of
the value interval. At the end of the genetic algorithm, the chromosome
with the best value is the 
\begin{equation}
IX=\left(IX_{1},IX_{2},\ldots,IX_{n}\right)
\end{equation}
So, the initial interval set for the parameters of the neural network
is calculated as
\begin{equation}
I_{N}=\left\{ \left[-IX_{1},IX_{1}\right],\left\{ -IX_{2},IX_{2}\right\} ,\ldots,\left[-IX_{n},IX_{n}\right]\right\} 
\end{equation}
The first phase of the proposed technique will accept the set $I_{N}$
as input and seek to compute a new set by reducing the training error
of the artificial neural network. The first step is mainly a genetic
algorithm and the corresponding steps are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Set} $N_{c}$ as the number of chromosomes for the Grammatical
Evolution.
\item \textbf{Set} as $H$ the number of weights for the neural network.
\item \textbf{Set} $N_{g}$ the maximum number of allowed generations.
\item \textbf{Set} as $p_{s}$ the selection rate , with $p_{s}\le1$.
\item \textbf{Set} as $p_{m}$ the mutation rate, with $p_{m}\le1$.
\item \textbf{Set} $N_{s}$ as the number of randomly created neural networks,
that will be used in the fitness calculation.
\item \textbf{Initialize} randomly the $N_{c}$ chromosomes. Every chromosome
is a set of integer numbers used to produce valid programs through
Grammatical Evolution and the associated grammar of Figure \ref{fig:BNF-grammar-of}.
\item \textbf{Set} $f^{*}=\left[\infty,\infty\right]$, the best discovered
fitness. For this algorithm, we consider the fitness function $f_{g}$
of any given chromosome $g$ as an interval \textbf{$f_{g}=\left[f_{g,\mbox{low}},f_{g,\mbox{upper}}\right]$}
\item \textbf{Set} iter=0. 
\item \textbf{For} $i=1,\ldots,N_{c}$ \textbf{do\label{enu:For--do}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Create }for the chromosome $c_{i}$ the corresponding program
$p_{i}$ using the grammar of Figure \ref{fig:BNF-grammar-of}.
\item \textbf{Apply }the program $p_{i}$ to $I_{N}$ in order to produce
the bounds $\left[\vec{L_{p_{i}}},\overrightarrow{R_{p_{i}}}\right]$. 
\item \textbf{Set} $E_{\mbox{min}}=\infty,\ E_{\mbox{max}}=-\infty$
\item \textbf{For} $j=1,\ldots,N_{S}$ \textbf{do}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Create} randomly $g_{j}\in$$\left[\vec{L_{p_{i}}},\overrightarrow{R_{p_{i}}}\right]$
as a set for the parameters of neural network.
\item \textbf{Calculate} the associated training error $E_{g_{j}}=\sum_{k=1}^{M}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x}_{k},\overrightarrow{g_{j}}\right)-y_{k}\right)^{2}$
\item \textbf{If} $E_{g_{j}}\le E_{\mbox{min}}$ \textbf{then} $E_{\mbox{min}}=E_{g_{j}}$
\item \textbf{If} $E_{g_{j}}\ge E_{\mbox{max}}$ \textbf{then} $E_{\mbox{max}}=E_{g_{j}}$
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{EndFor}
\item \textbf{Set} $f_{i}=\left[E_{\mbox{min}},E_{\mbox{max}}\right]$ as
the fitness value for the chromosome $c_{i}$.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{EndFor }
\item \textbf{Apply} the selection procedure. Firstly, the chromosomes are
sorted with correspondence to their fitness values. Since fitness
is considered an interval, a fitness comparison function is required.
For this reason the operator $L^{*}\left(f_{a},f_{b}\right)$ to compare
two fitness values $f_{a}=\left[a_{1},a_{2}\right]$ and $f_{b}=\left[b_{1},b_{2}\right]$
as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
L^{*}\left(f_{a},f_{b}\right) & = & \begin{cases}
\mbox{TRUE}, & a_{1}<b_{1},\mbox{OR\ \ensuremath{\left(a_{1}=b_{1}\ \mbox{AND}\ a_{2}<b_{2}\right)}}\\
\mbox{FALSE}, & \mbox{\mbox{OTHERWISE}}
\end{cases}\label{eq:eql}
\end{eqnarray}
In practice this means that the fitness value $f_{a}$ is considered
smaller than $f_{b}$ if $L^{*}\left(f_{a},f_{b}\right)=\mbox{TRUE}$.
The first $\left(1-p_{s}\right)\times N_{c}$ chromosomes with the
lowest fitness values are copied to the next generation. The remaining
chromosomes are substituted by chromosomes produced by the crossover
procedure. During the selection process, for every new offspring,
two chromosomes are selected as parents from the population using
well - known procedure of tournament selection. 
\item \textbf{Apply} the crossover procedure.\textbf{ }For each pair $(z,w)$
of parents, two new chromosomes $\tilde{z}$ and $\tilde{w}$ are
created using the one - point crossover, graphically shown in Figure
\ref{fig:onepoint}.
\item \textbf{Apply} the mutation procedure. For each element of every chromosome
alter the corresponding element with probability $p_{m}$.
\item \textbf{Set} iter=iter+1
\item \textbf{If} $\mbox{iter\ensuremath{\le N_{g}} }$goto step \ref{enu:For--do}.

\subsection{The second phase of the proposed method}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Initialization Step}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Set} $N_{c}$ as the number of chromosomes that participate
in the genetic algorithm.
\item \textbf{Set} $N_{g}$ the maximum number of allowed iterations.
\item \textbf{Set} $H$ the number of weights for the neural network.
\item \textbf{Get} the best interval $S$ from the previous step of subsection
\ref{subsec:The-first-phase}.
\item \textbf{Initialize} using uniform distribution the $N_{C}$ chromosomes
in $S$. 
\item \textbf{Set} as $p_{s}$ the selection rate, with $p_{s}\le1$.
\item \textbf{Set} as $p_{m}$ the mutation rate, with $p_{m}\le1$.
\item \textbf{Set} iter=0.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Fitness calculation Step \label{enu:Fitness-calculation-Step}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{For} $i=1,\ldots,N_{g}$ \textbf{do}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Calculate} the fitness $f_{i}$ of chromosome $g_{i}$ as
$f_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{M}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x}_{j},\overrightarrow{g_{i}}\right)-y_{j}\right)^{2}$
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{EndFor}
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Genetic operations step}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Selection procedure.} Initially, the chromosomes are sorted
according to their fitness values. The first $\left(1-p_{s}\right)\times N_{c}$
chromosomes with the lowest fitness values are copied to the next
generation. The remaining chromosomes are substituted by chromosomes
produced by the crossover procedure. During the selection process,
for every new offspring, two chromosomes are selected as parents from
the population using well - known procedure of tournament selection. 
\item \textbf{Crossover procedure}: For each pair $(z,w)$ of selected parents,
two chromosomes $\tilde{z}$ and $\tilde{w}$ are constructed using
the following equations:
\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde{z_{i}} & = & a_{i}z_{i}+\left(1-a_{i}\right)w_{i}\nonumber \\
\tilde{w_{i}} & = & a_{i}w_{i}+\left(1-a_{i}\right)z_{i}\label{eq:crossover_ali-1}
\end{eqnarray}
Where $a_{i}$ is random number with the property $a_{i}\in[-0.5,1.5]$
\citep{kaelo}. 
\item \textbf{Mutation procedure}:\textbf{ }For each element of every chromosome
alter the corresponding element with probability $p_{m}$.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Termination Check Step}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Set} $iter=iter+1$ 
\item \textbf{If} $\mbox{iter\ensuremath{\le N_{g}} }$goto step \ref{enu:Fitness-calculation-Step}.
else apply a local search procedure to the best chromosome of the
population. In the current work the BFGS variant of Powell \citep{powell}
was used.

In general, the proposed technique outperforms the rest of the techniques
in the experiments. In fact, in many cases, the test error is reduced
by more than 70\%. Also, more experiments were conducted using the
number of processing nodes ($H$) as well the number of generations
($N_{t}$), to determine the stability of the proposed technique.
The average classification error for the classification datasets using
different values for the $H$ parameter is shown graphically in Figure
\ref{fig:experimentsH}. Furthermore, the average classification error
of the proposed method for different number of maximum generations
$N_{t}$ is shown graphically in Figure \ref{fig:experiments_nt}.
The proposed technique does not show significant changes in its behavior
as the critical parameters change and therefore its stability to changes
is evident. Also, the average execution time for different values
of the $N_{t}$ parameter is outlined in Figure \ref{fig:experiments_time}.
Judging from the above experiments, it can be said that the choice
of values for the critical parameters $H$ and $N_{t}$ is a compromise
between performance and speed for the proposed technique.

The numerical superiority of the proposed technique over the others
in the performed experiments is presented graphically and in the figures
\ref{fig:ScatterClass} and \ref{fig:ScatterRegression}, where Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests were performed on the executed experiments. However,
since the proposed technique consists exclusively of a series of genetic
algorithms, it can be significantly accelerated by the use of parallel
computing techniques, since one of the main characteristics of genetic
algorithms is their ease of parallelization \citep{genpar1,genpar2}.
Programming techniques that can be used to parallelize the method
could be the MPI programming interface \citep{openmpi} or the OpenMP
programming library \citep{openmp}.

\section{Conclusions \label{sec:Conclusions}}

This paper proposed a two-step technique to efficiently find a reliable
interval of values for the parameters of artificial neural networks.
In the first stage with partitioning techniques and using Grammatical
Evolution, a range of parameter values was searched and, in the second
stage, a genetic algorithm trained the artificial neural network within
the optimal range of values of the first stage. The proposed technique
is highly general and has been successfully applied to both data fitting
and classification problems. In both cases, the experimental results
demonstrate its superiority over other techniques appearing in the
relevant literature on the training of artificial neural networks.
In fact, in many cases in the performed experiments, the proposed
method outperforms others that were tested in percentages that exceed
70\%. In the future, a series of actions can be carried out to improve
the results and speed up the proposed method, such as:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is a need for more efficient techniques for initializing the
value space for artificial neural network parameters. In the present
work, the optimal result from the execution of a limited number of
steps by a genetic algorithm was used as an initial estimate of the
value interval.
\item In the present work, the same techniques as in any whole-chromosome
genetic algorithm were used to perform the crossover and mutation
operations. Research could be done at this point to find more focused
crossover and mutation techniques for this particular problem.
\item The present technique consists of two phases, in each of which a problem-adapted
genetic algorithm is executed. This means that significant computational
time is required to complete the algorithm. However, since genetic
algorithms are inherently parallelizable, modern parallel programming
techniques could be used here.
