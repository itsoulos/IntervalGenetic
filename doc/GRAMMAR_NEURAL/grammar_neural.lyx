% For posting an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use "preprints" as the journal and change "submit" to "accept". The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

\begin_layout Abstract
Artificial neural networks are widely established models of computational
 intelligence that have been tested for effectiveness in a variety of real-world
 applications.
 These models require fitting a set of parameters through the use of some
 optimization technique.
 However, an issue that researchers often face is finding an efficient range
 of values for the parameters of the artificial neural network.
 This paper proposes an innovative technique of generating a promising range
 of values for the parameters of the artificial neural network.
 Finding the value field is performed by a series of rules for partitioning
 the original set of values or expanding it, which rules are generated using
 Grammatical Evolution.
 After finding a promising interval of values any optimization technique
 such as a genetic algorithm can be used to train the artificial neural
 network on that interval of values.
 The new technique was tested on a wide range of problems from the relevant
 literature and the results were extremely promising.
