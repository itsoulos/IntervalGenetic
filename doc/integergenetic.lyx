\begin_layout Abstract
An advanced method of training artificial neural networks is presented here,
 which aims to identify the optimal interval for initialization and training
 of artificial neural networks.
 The location of the optimal interval is performed using rules evolving
 from a genetic algorithm.
 The method has two phases: in the first phase, an attempt is made to locate
 the optimal interval and in the second phase, the artificial neural network
 is initialized and trained in this interval using a method of global optimizati
on, such as genetic algorithms.
 The method has been tested on a range of categorization and function learning
 data and the experimental results are extremely encouraging.

\begin_layout Standard
Artificial Neural networks (ANNs) are programming tools 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 based on a series of parameters that are commonly called weights or processing
 units.
 They have been used in a variety of problems from different scientific
 areas, such as physics

 etc.
 A common way to express a neural network is a function 
\begin_inset Formula $N(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w})$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x}$
\end_inset

 the input vector (commonly called pattern) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{w}$
\end_inset

 the weight vector.
 A method that trains a neural network should be used to estimate the vector
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{w}$
\end_inset

 for a certain problem.
 The training procedure can also be formulated as an optimization problem,
 where the target is to minimize the so-called error function:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x}_{i},\overrightarrow{w}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:eq1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},y_{i}\right),\ i=1,...,M$
\end_inset

 is the dataset used to train the neural network, with 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 being the actual output for the point 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x_{i}}$
\end_inset

 .
 The neural network 
\begin_inset Formula $N(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w})$
\end_inset

 can be modeled as a summation of processing units as proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "nnc"
literal "false"

\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{H}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)}\sigma\left(\sum_{j=1}^{d}x_{j}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)+j}+w_{(d+2)i}\right)\label{eq:nn}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is the number of processing units of the neural network and 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is the dimension of vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x}$
\end_inset

.
 The function
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(x)$
\end_inset

 is the sigmoid function defined as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}\label{eq:sig}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

From the equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:nn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 one can obtain that the dimension of the weight vector 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is computed as: 
\begin_inset Formula $n=(d+2)H$
\end_inset

.
 The function of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 has been minimized with a variety of optimization methods during the past
 years such as: the Back Propagation method

 Also, various researchers have worked on the initialization of the weights

\end_inset

 etc.
 Another topic that attracted the interest of many researchers is the weight
 decaying, which is a regularization method that adapts the weights of the
 network aiming to avoid the overfitting problem.

 Furthermore, due to development of GPU units a lot of works have been published
 that take advantage of these processing units

\begin_layout Standard
The present work proposes an innovative interval generation technique for
 the initialization and training of artificial neural network parameters.
 This new method has its roots in interval methods 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "interval0,interval1,interval2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In current work, using arithmetic intervals, a set of rules for dividing
 the initial interval for the parameters of the artificial neural network
 is constructed.
 The construction is carried out using a hybrid genetic algorithm, in which
 chromosomes are the set of division rules.
 After the termination of the genetic algorithm, the artificial neural network
 is initialized in the interval resulting from the application of the optimal
 partitioning rules and then trained using a genetic algorithm.

\series bold
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This method used has two objectives: the first objective is to detect a
 small interval of initialization of the parameters of the artificial neural
 network and the second objective is to accelerate the training of the network.
 In the first target, using information from the training data the algorithm
 will make an attempt to identify that interval that will ultimately give
 better results.
 In the second objective, once a small value interval has been detected,
 a global optimization method can be used more efficiently to detect the
 lowest value of the network error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed method is expected to achieve significant results since in
 principle it has all the advantages of genetic algorithms, such as tolerance
 on errors, possibilities for parallel implementation, efficient exploration
 of the research space, etc.
 In addition, in the first phase of the method will reduce the volume of
 the possible values for the weights, so that in the second phase the search
 for global minimum of the network error function becomes more efficient
 and faster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed methodology can even be applied to different types of artificial
 neural networks such as Recurrent Neural networks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "rnn1,rnn2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 A simple recurrent neural network can be expressed as single neural cell
 with a single input, a single output and a state (also known as the memory
 of the cell).
 Given the input of the cell 
\begin_inset Formula $x(t)$
\end_inset

 at step 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and the previous state of the cell 
\begin_inset Formula $h(t-1)$
\end_inset

 at step 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

 the updated state of the cell 
\begin_inset Formula $h(t)$
\end_inset

 is estimated as shown in the equation: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\textbf{h}(t)=f\left(\textbf{W}_{hh}*\textbf{h}(t-1)+\textbf{W}_{xh}*\textbf{x}(t)+\textbf{b}_{h}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{y}(t)=σ\left(\boldsymbol{W}_{hy}\text{∗}h(t)+\boldsymbol{b}_{y}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 function is usually the softmax function.
 The proposed method can be used here to estimate a promising bounding box
 for the vector parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{W},\textbf{b}$
\end_inset

 of the network before any other training method is applied.

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed method consists of two major steps: in the first step, the
 construction of the partition rules of the initial value interval for the
 parameters of the artificial neural network is made and in the second step,
 the artificial neural network is initialized in the optimal space resulting
 from the first step and training takes place.
 The training is performed through a second genetic algorithm.
 In the first genetic algorithm, the chromosomes are sets of partition rules
 of the initial value interval of the artificial neural network, and in
 the second genetic algorithm, the chromosomes are the parameters of the
 artificial neural network.
 It is obvious that this is a time consuming process and modern parallel
 techniques such as the OpenMP 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 library must be used to accelerate it.
 The first genetic algorithm is analyzed in subsection

Locating the best rules 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, we introduce the rule set 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{n}$
\end_inset

 where:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
I_{n}=\left\{ \left(l_{1},r_{1}\right),\left(l_{2},r_{2}\right),\ldots,\left(l_{n},r_{n}\right)\right\} \label{eq:I_eq}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{i}\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} ,\ r_{i}\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} ,\ i=1,\ldots,n$
\end_inset

.
 The set 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{n}$
\end_inset

 defines the set of partition rules for a function defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f:S\rightarrow R,S\subset R^{n}\label{eq:f_eq}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S=\left[a_{1},b_{1}\right]\otimes\left[a_{2},b_{2}\right]\otimes\ldots\left[a_{n},b_{n}\right]\label{eq:eq_defines}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

If 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{i}=1$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}=\frac{a_{i}}{2}$
\end_inset

 and if 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}=1$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}=\frac{b_{i}}{2}$
\end_inset

.
 For example consider the Rastrigin function: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f(x)=x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}-\cos\left(18x_{1}\right)-\cos\left(18x_{2}\right),\ x\in[-1,1]^{2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Also consider the set 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{2}=\left\{ \left(1,0\right),\left(0,1\right)\right\} $
\end_inset

 The produced bounding box for the Rastrigin function is now 
\begin_inset Formula $S'=\left[-0.5,1\right]\times\left[-1,0.5\right]$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subsequently, we introduce the extended set 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{Kn}$
\end_inset

 as a set of production rules defined as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R_{Kn}=\left\{ I_{n}^{(1)},I_{n}^{(2)},\ldots,I_{n}^{(K)}\right\} \label{eq:ck}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{n}^{(i)},\ i=1,..,K$
\end_inset

 are rule sets of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:I_eq"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 For example let 
\begin_inset Formula $K=2$
\end_inset

 for the Rastrigin function and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{22}=\left\{ \left\{ \left(0,1\right),\left(1,0\right)\right\} ,\left\{ \left(1,0\right),\left(1,1\right)\right\} \right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The final bounding box is considered after applying the sets 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \left(0,1\right),\left(1,0\right)\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \left(1,0\right),\left(1,1\right)\right\} $
\end_inset

 in the original box 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 The computation steps are:

\begin_inset Formula $S''=\left[-0.25,1\right]\times\left[-0.5,0.25\right]$
\end_inset

We consider chromosomes in the form of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 for the first phase of the proposed method.
 The value 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the total number of parameters of the neural network.
 The fitness of every chromosome 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is an interval 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{g}=\left[f_{g,\mbox{min}},f_{g,\mbox{max}}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, in order to compare two different intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $a=\left[a_{1},a_{2}\right]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b=\left[b_{1},b_{2}\right]$
\end_inset

 we incorporate the following function: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
L^{*}(a,b) & = & \begin{cases}
\mbox{TRUE}, & a_{1}<b_{1},\mbox{OR\ \left(a_{1}=b_{1}\ \mbox{AND}\ a_{2}<b_{2}\right)}\\
\mbox{FALSE}, & \mbox{\mbox{OTHERWISE}}

.
 For classification problems, the average classification error on the test

 on the test set is displayed.

\series bold
 
\series default
In all cases, 10 fold cross validation was used and the number of hidden
 nodes (parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

) was set to 10.
 The column DATASET stands for the name of the Dataset incorporated, the
 column 
\begin_inset Formula $D=50$
\end_inset

 represents the application of the proposed method with 
\begin_inset Formula $D=50$
\end_inset

 as the initial value for the interval of weights, the column 
\begin_inset Formula $D=100$
\end_inset

 stands for the results of the proposed method with 
\begin_inset Formula $D=100$

 and finally the column 
\begin_inset Formula $D=200$
\end_inset

 represents the results of the proposed method with 
\begin_inset Formula $D=200$
\end_inset

.
 In both tables, an additional row was added at the end showing the average
 classification or regression error for all datasets and it is denoted by
 the name AVERAGE.
 All the experiments were conducted on an AMD Ryzen 5950X equipped with
 128GB of RAM.
 The operating system used was OpenSUSE Linux and all the programs are compiled
 using the GNU C++ compiler.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As can be seen from the experimental results, the proposed method is significant
ly superior than the other methods, especially in the case of regression
 data.
 The RPROP training method seems to overcome ADAM in most cases of classificatio
n datasets and the simple Genetic method is better thank ADAM and RPROP
 for classification datasets but not for regression datasets.
 Also, the change of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 does not seem to have a significant effect on the performance of the algorithm
 and the proposed algorithm achieves high performance even for small values
 of this parameter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, the average execution times for all the problems of this publicatio
n were compared between the proposed method and the methods ADAM, RPROP,
 GENETIC and NEAT mentioned above.
 The average execution times are presented graphically in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:time"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 In order to speed up the proposed method, the genetic algorithm used was
 parallelized using the open source library OpenMP 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "openmp"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The column THREAD1 stands for the average time execution of the proposed
 method with one thread, the column THREADS 2 represents the average execution
 time of the proposed method using two threads in the OpenMP implementation,
 the column THREADS 4 denotes the average execution time of the proposed
 method for four threads and finally the column THREADS 8 denotes the average
 execution time for eight threads for the OpenMP implementation.
 The proposed method has slow execution times when performed on one thread,
 but as the number of threads used increases the execution time decreases
 dramatically.
 This is very important, because it means that it could be used in large
 problems if the computer in use has enough execution threads.
 Obviously all methods of training artificial neural networks could be paralleli
zed in one way or another.
 The parallelization of the proposed method is done since it is by nature
 an extremely slow method, since it requires the use of two genetic algorithms
 in series.
 By using parallel techniques this problem is alleviated, however the computatio
nal cost remains high.
 But this is the only substantial price for using this technique.
 Also, a time comparison is made for the PageBlocks dataset between the
 proposed method and a parallel imlementation of the Adam algorithm named
 DADAM for number of threads ranging from 1 to 8.
 The time comparison is graphically illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:dadam"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make the dynamics of the proposed method clearer, another series of experimen
ts was performed.
 In these, the maximum number of generations (parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{t}$
\end_inset

) received three values: 20, 40 and 100 and for each value all experiments
 for classification and regression datasets were performed.
 The results for the classification datasets are listed in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:class_nt"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and the results for regression datasets are shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:regression_nt"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 As expected, the proposed method improves its performance as the maximum
 number of generations increases, but even for a small number of generations
 it has a satisfactory performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, to make a better and fairer comparison of the results, another
 set of experiments was performed with the genetic algorithm, in which the
 maximum number of generations was varied from 100 to 800, and the results
 are presented in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:genetic_nt_class"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for the classification datasets and in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:genetic_nt_regression"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 for the regression datasets.
 Observing these results, we can say that after 200 generations there is
 no significant difference in the efficiency of the genetic algorithm.

\begin_layout Standard
An innovative method of training artificial neural networks was presented
 in this paper.
 The method consists of two important phases: in the first phase through
 a hybrid genetic algorithm, an attempt is made to identify the optimal
 interval of initialization and training of the network parameters and at
 the second phase the training of the parameters in the optimal intervals
 of the first phase is done using a genetic algorithm.
 The optimization of the optimal interval in the first phase is done by
 using partition rules of the initial interval that are applied in order.
 This technique aims to reduce the parameter search space and then significantly
 speed up network configuration training.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed method was tested on a series of classification and regression
 datasets from the relevant literature and the experimental results seem
 to be very promising compared to the genetic algorithm procedure.
 However, since the method consists of two computational phases, it is much
 slower than other training techniques of artificial neural networks and
 therefore, the use of parallel processing techniques is considered necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Future improvements to the proposed method may include the incorporation
 of additional global optimization techniques instead of  genetic algorithms,
 the usage of more advanced stopping rules and the application of the method
 to other types of neural networks such as Radial Basis Function networks
 (RBF).
