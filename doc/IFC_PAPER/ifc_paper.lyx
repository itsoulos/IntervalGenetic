% For posting an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use "preprints" as the journal and change "submit" to "accept". The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

\begin_layout Abstract
The Grammatical Evolution technique has been successfully applied to a wide
 range of problems in various scientific fields.
 However, in Grammatical Evolution, the chromosomes can be initialized at
 wide value intervals, which can lead to a decrease in the efficiency of
 underlying technique.
 In this paper, a technique for discovering appropriate intervals for the
 initialization of chromosomes is proposed using partition rules guided
 by a genetic algorithm.
 This method has been applied to feature construction technique used in
 a variety of scientific papers.
 After successfully finding a promising interval, the feature construction
 technique is applied and the chromosomes are initialized within that interval.
 This technique was applied to a number of known problems in the relevant
 literature and the results were extremely promising.

(accessed on 9 September 2023).
 The results were validated using the 10 - fold validation technique in
 all datasets.
 The experiments were executed 30 times for each dataset using a different
 seed for the random generator each time.
 The average classification error is reported for the case of classification
 datasets and the average mean test error for the regression datasets.
 The machine used in the experiments was an AMD Ryzen 5950X with 128GB of
 RAM, running the Debian Linux operating system.
