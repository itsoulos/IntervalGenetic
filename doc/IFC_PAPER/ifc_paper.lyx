% For posting an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use "preprints" as the journal and change "submit" to "accept". The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

\begin_layout Abstract
A multitude of real-world problems can usually be expressed as data classificati
on or data fitting problems.
 A technique that has been experimentally found to achieve good recognition
 results in such problems is the technique of feature construction with
 the incorporation of Grammatical Evolution.
 However, in Grammatical Evolution, the chromosomes can initialized in wide
 value intervals, which can lead to a decrease in the efficiency of the
 feature construction technique.
 In this paper, a technique for discovering appropriate intervals for the
 initialization of chromosomes is proposed using partition rules guided
 by a genetic algorithm.
 After successfully finding a promising interval, the feature construction
 technique is applied and the chromosomes are initialized within that interval.
 This technique was applied to a number of known problems in the relevant
 literature and the results were extremely promising.
