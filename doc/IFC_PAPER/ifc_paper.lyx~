\begin_layout Abstract
The Grammatical Evolution technique has been successfully applied to a wide
 range of problems in various scientific fields.
 However, in Grammatical Evolution, the chromosomes can be initialized at
 wide value intervals, which can lead to a decrease in the efficiency of
 underlying technique.
 In this paper, a technique for discovering appropriate intervals for the
 initialization of chromosomes is proposed using partition rules guided
 by a genetic algorithm.
 This method has been applied to feature construction technique used in
 a variety of scientific papers.
 After successfully finding a promising interval, the feature construction
 technique is applied and the chromosomes are initialized within that interval.
 This technique was applied to a number of known problems in the relevant
 literature and the results were extremely promising.

 solutions (called also chromosomes) of any optimization problem, are evolved
 iteratively by applying procedures based on natural processes, such as
 selection, crossover and mutation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important issue of the Grammatical Evolution technique is that usually
 the integer chromosomes take values in a large interval of values, e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0\ldots255\right]$
\end_inset

 as a result of which there is a significant delay in finding the most suitable
 programs, as many of the values in the above interval are not used.
 Furthermore, in many cases the performance of Grammatical Evolution is
 not as expected and a numerous chromosomes and/or generations are required
 in order to find the most suitable program.
 The present work proposes a two-step technique to solve the above problem.
 In the first step of the proposed technique, the value limits for the elements
 of the chromosomes are estimated using a genetic algorithm and a similar
 approach as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "tsoulos_dnc"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, and in the second stage, the Grammatical Evolution chromosomes are initialized
 within the best value interval of the first stage.
 The proposed approach was tested in the feature construction procedure
 initially suggested in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "fc1"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This approach of creating artificial features with Grammatical Evolution
 has also been used in many cases, such as Spam Identification

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 etc.
 The usage of the proposed interval technique in the construction of features
 significantly increased the performance of the method both in classification
 problems and in regression problems, as will be seen in the experiments
 section.
 However, the proposed interval technique is quite general and can be applied
 to other problems dealt with by Grammatical Evolution.

he Grammatical Evolution production procedure initiates from the start symbol

 non - terminal symbols with the right hand of the selected production rule.
 Every rule is selected using the following two steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Itemize
The next rule is selected through the equation Rule = V mod NR, where NR
 is the number of production rules for the current non – terminal symbol.

The proposed method

\begin_layout Standard
In the present technique, a procedure is conducted before the initialization

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 This process using a modified genetic algorithm aims to find the optimal
 value interval for the chromosome elements.
 In the proposed method the chromosomes are sets of intervals as well as
 the fitness values.
 Hence, a comparison operator should be used in order to compare intervals.
 In order to compare the intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $a=\left[a_{1},a_{2}\right]$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b=\left[b_{1},b_{2}\right]$
\end_inset

, the operator is 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{*}(a,b)$
\end_inset

 used defined as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
L^{*}(a,b) & = & \begin{cases}
\mbox{TRUE}, & a_{1}<b_{1},\mbox{OR\ \ensuremath{\left(a_{1}=b_{1}\ \mbox{AND}\ a_{2}<b_{2}\right)}}\\
\mbox{FALSE}, & \mbox{\mbox{OTHERWISE}}

From the experimental results and their careful study, one can deduce that
 the original feature construction method significantly outperforms simple
 machine learning techniques in terms of classification error or function
 approximation error.
 The feature construction method achieved low errors by creating only 2
 artificial features from the existing ones and thus significantly reduced
 the required information needed for successful classification or data fitting.
 In addition, the proposed value interval generation technique (IFC10 or
 IFC20) significantly improves the feature construction technique, both
 on classification data and data fitting data.
 Furthermore, a statistical comparison was performed using scatter plot
 and the results are outlined in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The results show that FC significantly outperforms both MLP and RBF, IFC10

The scatter plot (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ifc_scatter"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

) effectively demonstrates the comparative performance of various classification
 methods in terms of classification error percentage.
 The methods evaluated are Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function
 (RBF), the simple feature construction technique (FC), and two variants
 of the proposed modification named IFC10 and IFC20 respectively.
 The FC method shows a lower median classification error compared to both
 MLP and RBF, with the differences being statistically significant (as indicated
 by the asterisks).
 This suggests that the FC method outperforms MLP and RBF in terms of classifica
tion accuracy.
 When comparing FC to IFC10, IFC10 displays a lower median classification
 error, and the difference is statistically significant, suggesting that
 IFC10 is an improvement over the standard FC method.
 Between IFC10 and IFC20, the median classification errors are close, and
 the lack of asterisks ('ns' for not significant) between these two methods
 indicates that the difference in classification error is not statistically
 significant.
 This suggests that the critical parameter change from IFC10 to IFC20 does
 not have a significant impact on classification accuracy.

 From the plot, we can see that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The FC method has a lower median regression error than both the MLP and
 RBF methods.
 This is statistically significant, as indicated by the asterisks (** for
 p < 0.01 between FC and RBF, and *** for p < 0.001 between FC and MLP), suggestin
g that FC is indeed a better method compared to MLP and RBF.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The IFC10 method shows a lower median regression error compared to the FC
 method, with this difference being statistically significant (** for p
 < 0.01).
 This suggests that IFC10 is a better method compared to FC.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Between IFC10 and IFC20, the median regression error is similar, and the
 difference is not statistically significant (ns for not significant).
 This indicates that there is no significant difference in regression error
 between IFC10 and IFC20 when the parameter is changed from 10 to 20.

\begin_layout Standard
In the current work, an efficient technique was proposed to identify the
 bounding box of the values of chromosomes in Grammatical Evolution.
 The proposed method precedes Grammatical Evolution and aims to discover
 a promising value interval for the chromosome values and, in this way,
 will significantly reduce the computational time required afterward but
 at the same time make the research more efficient.
 The method was tested on the Feature Construction technique, which is guided
 by Grammatical Evolution.
 Experimental results and statistical comparison show a significant reduction
 in classification error and data fitting error using the proposed technique.
 In addition, from the statistical comparison of the results, it appeared
 that there is no direct effect of the number of generations of the genetic
 algorithm on the effectiveness of the method, which means that only a few
 generations are enough to effectively find the promising value interval.
 Although the proposed technique was applied to the feature generation method,
 it is quite general and in the future it will be able to be applied to
 other application areas of Grammatical Evolution such as the construction
 of artificial neural networks, the rule generation method, etc.
 However, a major drawback of the present technique is that it requires
 a significant amount of computing resources for its execution, but this
 can be alleviated by using parallel computing techniques, such as the MPI
 programming library
